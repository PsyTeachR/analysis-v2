## PreClass Activity

```{r lab15-preclass-setup, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pinfo <- read_csv("data/15-s02/inclass/participant_info.csv")
wellbeing <- read_csv("data/15-s02/inclass/wellbeing.csv")
screen <- read_csv("data/15-s02/inclass/screen_time.csv")
```

In this final PreClass we have two activities. The first is a very short blog by Prof. Dorothy Bishop that helps draw the links between ANOVA and Regression. The second is really the first part of the InClass activity. It is quite a long InClass, which you will be able to cope with, but we have split it across the PreClass and InClass to allow you some time to get some of the more basic wrangling steps out of the way and so you can come to the class and focus on the actual analysis. It would be worth doing most, if not all, of the activity now.

### Activity

**Background: Smartphone screen time and wellbeing**

There is currently much debate (and hype) surrounding smartphones and their effects on well-being, especially with regard to children and teenagers. We'll be looking at data from this recent study of English adolescents:

> Przybylski, A. & Weinstein, N. (2017). A Large-Scale Test of the Goldilocks Hypothesis. *Psychological Science*, *28*, 204--215.

This was a large-scale study that found support for the "Goldilocks" hypothesis among adolescents: that there is a "just right" amount of screen time, such that any amount more or less than this amount is associated with lower well-being. Much like the work you have been doing, this was a *huge* survey study with data containing responses from *over 120,000* participants! Fortunately, the authors made the data from this study openly available, which allows us to dig deeper into their results. And the question we want to expand on in this exercise is whether the relationship between screen time and well-being is modulated by partcipant's (self-reported) sex. In other words, does screen time have a bigger impact on males or females, or is it the same for both?

The dependent measure used in the study was the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/research/platform/wemwbs/" target = "_blank">Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS)</a>. This is a 14-item scale with 5 response categories, summed together to form a single score ranging from 14-70.

On [Przybylski & Weinstein's page for this study on the Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/82ybd/), you can find the [participant survey](https://osf.io/82ybd/), which asks a large number of additional questions (see page 14 for the WEMWBS questions and pages 4-5 for the questions about screen time). Within the same page you can also find the [raw data](https://osf.io/82ybd/); however, for the purpose of this exercise, you will be using local pre-processed copies of the data found in the accompanying zip file on Moodle or [download from here](data/15-s02/inclass/ch15-preclass-inclass-data.zip).

Przybylski and Weinstein looked at multiple measures of screen time, but again for the interests of this exercise we will be focusing on smartphone use, but do feel free to expand your skills after by looking at different definitions of screen time. Overall, Przybylski and Weinstein suggested that decrements in wellbeing started to appear when respondents reported more than one hour of daily smartphone use. So, bringing it back to our additional variable of sex, our question is now, does the negative association between hours of use and wellbeing (beyond the one-hour point) differ for boys and girls?

Let's think about this in terms of the variables. We have:

- a continuous$^*$ DV, well-being;

- a continuous$^*$ predictor, screen time;

- a categorical predictor, sex.

**Note:** these variables ($^*$) are technically only **quasi-continuous** inasmuch as that only discrete values are possible. However, there are a sufficient number of discrete categories in our data that we can treat the data as effectively continuous.

Now, in terms of analysis, what we are effectively trying to do is to estimate **two slopes** relating screen time to well-being, one for girls and one for boys, and then statistically compare these slopes. Sort of like running a correlation for boys, a correlation for girls, and comparing the two. Or alternatively, where you would run a regression (to estimate the slopes) but also one where you would need a t-test (to compare two groups). But the expressive power of regression allows us to do this all within a single model. Again, as we have seen building up to this lab, **an independent groups t-test is just a special case of ordinary regression with a single categorical predictor; ANOVA is just a special case of regression where all predictors are categorical.** But remember, although we can express any ANOVA design using regression, the converse is not true: we cannot express every regression design in ANOVA. As such people like regression, and the general linear model, as it allows us to have any combination of continuous and categorical predictors in the model. The only inconvenience with running ANOVA models as regression models is that you have to take care in how you numerically code the categorical predictors. We will use an approach called **deviation coding** which we will look at today later in this lab.

**Let's Begin!**

### Loading in the data {#Ch15PreClassQueT1}

As always we will need to load in the tidyverse package and load in the data from the accompanying csv files, `wellbeing.csv`, `participant_info.csv`, and `screen_time.csv`.  

* Create a new R Markdown file and put the csv files in the same directory with the Rmd file you've just created. Then load them in as follows (the solution is at the end of the chapter):

* **pinfo** stores participant_info.csv
* **wellbeing** stores wellbeing.csv
* **screen** stores screen_time.csv

**The Data**

Take a look at the resulting tibbles `pinfo`, `wellbeing`, and `screen`.  The `wellbeing` tibble has information from the **WEMWBS** questionnaire; `screen` has information about screen time use on weekends (variables ending with `we`) and weekdays (variables ending with `wk`) for four types of activities: using a computer (variables starting with `Comph`; Q10 on the survey), playing video games (variables starting with `Comp`; Q9 on the survey), using a smartphone (variables starting with `Smart`; Q11 on the survey) and watching TV (variables starting with `Watch`; Q8 on the survey).  If you want more information about these variables, look at the items 8-11 on pages 4-5 of the the [PDF version of the survey on the OSF website](https://osf.io/82ybd/).

* note that sex is coded as male = 1, female = 0.
* also, Serial is common across all datasets and is the participant ID.

### Compute the well-being score for each participant {#Ch15PreClassQueT2}

Ok, our data is in and we need to create a well-being score for each participant on each item of the WEMWBS. To do this, and to calculate the well-being score for each participant, we simply **sum** all the items together for that participant. 

* Write code to create a new tibble, called `wemwbs`, with two variables: `Serial`, and `tot_wellbeing`, which is the the total WEMWBS score for each participant.

`r hide("Hint to compute scores")`
```{block, type ="info"}

**Step 1:** 

- reshape table from wide to long using `pivot_longer()`. We suggest creating a new column called `var` with the labels and a new column called `score` and gathering all the columns except Serial (e.g. `cols = -Serial`)

**Step 2:** 

- `group_by()`; `summarise(tot_wellbeing = ...)`
- Alternatively, mutate on the sum of all columns, then select the two needed.
```
`r unhide()`

```{r wemwbs, echo=FALSE}
wemwbs <- wellbeing %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "var", values_to = "score", cols = -Serial) %>%
  group_by(Serial) %>%
  summarise(tot_wellbeing = sum(score))
```

### Visualising Screen time on all technologies {#Ch15PreClassQueT3}

Great, so we have the well-being scores sorted out, we now need to think about the screen time usage and whether it is being used on a weekday or a weekend. As always, to get an idea of the data, it is often very useful to visualize the distributions of variables before proceeding with the analysis.

* Try recreating this figure based on the data in `screen`. Note that this will require some tidying of the data in `screen`:

1. You'll first need to gather the `screen` tibble into long format and then break apart the column names into **two** separate columns, one for the name of the variable (`Watch`, `Comp`, `Comph`, and `Smart`) and the other for part of the week (`wk` and `we`). This is going to take using the `separate()` function which we haven't used yet but we think you can manage using the hints below.

2. Next, you'll need to alter the values of the variables to reflect the more descriptive text that appears in the plot (e.g., `"Watch"` becomes `"Watching TV"`; `"wk"` becomes `"Weekday"`). This is a `recode()` issue which you have done a number of times.

This is quite a tricky bit of wrangling which we think you are capable of but, do not be put off if you can't quite get it yet.  The code is at the end of the chapter for you to use once you have had a shot at it.

```{r ch15-st-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Count of the hours of usage of different types of social media at Weekdays and Weekends'}
## screen time
screen_long <- screen %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "var", values_to = "hours", cols = -Serial) %>%
  separate(var, c("variable", "day"), "_")

screen2 <- screen_long %>%
  mutate(variable = recode(variable,
			   "Watch" = "Watching TV",
			   "Comp" = "Playing Video Games",
			   "Comph" = "Using Computers",
			   "Smart" = "Using Smartphone"),
	 day = recode(day,
		      "wk" = "Weekday",
		      "we" = "Weekend"))

ggplot(screen2, aes(hours)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_grid(day ~ variable)
```

`r hide("Hints on Wrangling Steps 1 and 2")`
```{block, type ="info"}
**Step 1**

- `pivot_longer()` the data in `screen` into three columns: Serial, var, hours. Do this by gathering all the columns together except Serial (e.g. `cols = -Serial`) and creating the new columns of `var` with the label names and `hours` with the values in it.
- `?separate()` in the console
- `seperate(data, column_name_containing_variables_to_split, c("column_1_to_create","column_2_to_create"), "character_to_split_by")`
- each variable (category) has an underscore in its name. Use that to split it. I.e. `Comph_we` will get split into `Comph` and `we` if you split by `_`
    
**Step 2**

data %>% 
mutate(new_variable_name = recode(old_variable_name, "wk" = "Weekday", "we" = "Weekend")) 
```
`r unhide()`

### Visualising the Screen time and Well-being relationship {#Ch15PreClassQueT4}

Brilliant, that is truly excellent work and you should be really pleased with yourself. Looking at the figures, it would appear that there is not much difference between screen time use of smartphones in weekend and weekdays so we could maybe collapse that variable together later when we come to analyse it. Overall, people tend to be using all the different technologies for a peak around 3 hours, and then each distribution tails off as you get longer exposure suggesting that there are some that stay online a long time. Video games is the exception where there is a huge peak in the first hour and then a tailing off after that.

But first, another visualisation. We should have a look at the relationship between screen time (for the four different technologies) and measures of well-being. This relationship looks like this shown below and the code to recreate this figure is underneath:

```{r combined-hide, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Scatterplot showing the relationship between screen time and mean well-being across four technologies for Weekdays and Weekends'}
dat_means <- inner_join(wemwbs, screen2, "Serial") %>%
  group_by(variable, day, hours) %>%
  summarise(mean_wellbeing = mean(tot_wellbeing))

ggplot(dat_means, aes(hours, mean_wellbeing, linetype = day)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~variable, nrow = 2)
```

At the start we said we were only going to focus on smartphones. So looking at the bottom left of the figure we could suggest that smartphone use of more than 1 hour per day is associated with increasingly negative well-being the longer screen time people have. This looks to be a similar effect for Weekdays and Weekends, though perhaps overall well-being in Weekdays is marginally lower than in Weekends (the line for Weekday is lower on the y-axis than Weekends). This makes some sense as people tend to be happier on Weekends! Sort of makes you wish we had more of them right?

That is great work today and it just shows you how far you have come with your wrangling skills over the last couple of years.  We will pick up from here in the lab during the week where we will start to look at the relationship in boys and girls. Don't forget to make any notes for yourself that you think will be good to remember - rounding off your Portfolio and bank on skills that you have built up. Any questions or problems, as always post them on the forums or bring them to the lab for discussion.
