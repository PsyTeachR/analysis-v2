# APES - Alpha, Power, Effect Sizes, Sample Size

## Overview

Up until now we have mainly spent time on data-wrangling, understanding probability, visualising our data, and more recently, running inferential tests, i.e. t-tests. In the lectures, however, you have also started to learn about additional aspects of inferential testing and trying to reduce certain types of error in your analyses. It is this balance of minimising error in our inferential statisitcs that we will focus on today. 

First thing to remember is that there are two types of hypotheses in Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) and what you are trying to establish is the probability of the null hypothesis not being accepted. Those two hypotheses are:

* The **null hypothesis** which states that the compared values **are equivalent** and, when referring to means, is written as: $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ 
* And the **alternative hypothesis** which states that the compared values **are not equivalent** and, when referring to means, is written as: $H_1: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$.

Now, each decision about a hypothesis is prone to some degree of error and, as you will learn, the two main types of error that we worry about in Psychology are:

* **Type I error** - or **False Positives**, is the error of rejecting the null hypothesis when it should not be rejected (otherwise called **alpha** or $\alpha$). In other words, you conclude that there is a real "effect" when in fact there is no effect. The field standard rate of acceptable false positives is $\alpha = .05$ meaning that in theory 1 in 20 studies may be a false positive.
* **Type II error** - or **False Negatives**, is the error of retaining the null hypothesis when it is false (otherwise called **beta** or $\beta$). In other words, you conclude that there was no real "effect" when in fact there was one. The field standard rate of acceptable false negatives is $\beta = .2$ meaning that in theory 1 in 5 studies may be a false negative. 

Adding to the ideas of hypotheses and errors, we are going to look at the idea of **power** which you will learn is the long-run probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis for a fixed effect size and fixed sample size; i.e. correctly concluding there is an effect when there is a real effect to detect. Power is calculated as $power = 1-\beta$ and is directly related to the False Negative rate. If the field standard of False Negatives is $\beta = .2$ then the field standard of power should be $power = 1 - .2 = .8$, for a given effect size and sample size (though some papers, including Registered Reports are often required to have a power of at least $power >= .9$). As such, $power = .8$ means that the majority of studies should find an effect if there is one to detect, assuming that your study maintains these rates of error and power.

Unfortunately, however, psychological research has been criticised for neglecting power and $\beta$ when planning studies resulting in what are called "underpowered" or "low powered" studies - meaning that your error rates are higher than you think they are, your power is lower than you think it is, and the study is unreliable. Note that as $\beta$ increases (the false negative rate increases), power decreases; power and false positive rates are also related, though less directly. In fact, low powered studies, combined with undisclosed analytical flexibility and publication bias, is thought to be a key issue in the replication crisis within the field. As such there may be a large number of studies where the null hypothesis has been rejected when it should not have been, and unpublished studies that have not been written up because they did not find an effect when they should have. In turn, when that is the case, the field becomes noisy and you are unsure which studies will replicate.  It is issues like this that led us to redevelop our courses and why we really want you to understand power as much as possible.

So this chapter is all about power, error rates, effect sizes, and sample sizes. We will learn:

* the relationship between power, alpha, effect sizes and sample sizes
* how to calculate certain effect sizes
* how to determine appropriate sample sizes in given scenarios
* and how to interpret power analyses.
