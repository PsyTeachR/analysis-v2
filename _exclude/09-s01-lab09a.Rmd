# Reflection - Chpts 1-9

## Overview

We have covered a lot of material in these first few chapters and now would be a good time to stop, recap, and reflect on what we have learnt.  As such, this chapter is more about looking back at what you have learnt, testing your skills, resolving issues, and looking at other cool applications of R that have not been covered in this lab series.
