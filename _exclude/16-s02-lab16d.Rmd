## Update Your Notes

Over the course of this book you have hugely developed your knowledge and skills in a variety of data skills, data management, data wrangling, and data analysis approaches. This is a great achievement and you should be very proud of youself. One thing to note though is that these skills are very much like learning a language or any other skill; the more you practice and the more you use them, they better you will become. As such, now would be an excellent time to review all your notes, check your understanding of the different approaches and sections, see what you know and what you are still uncertain of, and make yourself a plan to bring your notes together, fill in any gaps in your knowledge, and solidify your knowledge and learning. If you have any questions, please post them on the TEAMS channel or speak to a member of staff and donâ€™t forget to add any useful information to your Portfolio before you leave it too long and forget.
