## Solutions to Questions

Below you will find the solutions to the questions for the Activities for this chapter. Only look at them after giving the questions a good try and speaking to the tutor about any issues.

### InClass Activities

#### InClass Step 1

* The basic tibble would be created as follows.
* When it comes to $Y_{ij}$, simply typing in the values in order was what was needed.

```{r ch11InClass-s1-tibble}
library("tidyverse")

dmx <- tibble(i = rep(1:3, each = 4), 
              j = rep(1:4, times = 3),
              Yij = c(37, 80, 64, 51,
                    33, 47, 55, 41,
                    59, 23, 50, 60))
```

#### InClass Step 2

* The Grand Mean can be added as follows:

```{r ch11InClass-s2-answer}
dmx2 <- dmx %>%
  mutate(mu = mean(Yij))
```

* And would appear as:

```{r ch11InClass-s2-answer-show, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(dmx2,
             digits = 3,
             caption = "Decomposition Matrix with Grand Mean added") %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", box_css = "border: 0px;")
```

#### InClass Step 3

* The estimates $\hat{A}_1$, $\hat{A}_2$, $\hat{A}_3$, or in other words the unique contribution of each group, are calculated as follows.
* The key point is grouping by `i` so that each group is accounted for individually.

```{r ch11InClass-s3-answer}
dmx3 <- dmx2 %>%
  group_by(i) %>%
  mutate(Ai = mean(Yij) - mu) %>%
  ungroup()
```

* And would appear as:

```{r ch11InClass-s3-answer-show, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(dmx3,
             digits = 3,
             caption = "Decomposition Matrix with Group Estimates added") %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", box_css = "border: 0px;")
```

#### InClass Step 4

* The residuals are calculated as follows:

```{r ch11InClass-s4-answer}
dmx4 <- dmx3 %>%
  mutate(err = Yij - (mu + Ai))
```

* And would appear as:

```{r ch11InClass-s4-answer-show, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(dmx4,
             digits = 3,
             caption = "Decomposition Matrix with Residuals added") %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", box_css = "border: 0px;")
```

#### InClass Step 5 (version 1)

* `mutate()` on the squared values column
* `select()` only those columns
* `summarise(sum)` those columns

```{r ch11InClass-s5-answer}
sstbl <- dmx4 %>%
  mutate(Yij2 = Yij^2,
         mu2 = mu^2,
         Ai2 = Ai^2,
         err2 = err^2) %>%
  select(Yij2, mu2, Ai2, err2) %>%
  summarise(ss_Y = sum(Yij2),
            ss_mu = sum(mu2),
            ss_Ai = sum(Ai2),
            ss_err = sum(err2))
```

#### InClass Step 5 (version 2)

* There is an alternative way to do the above in a supercool, superquick, two lines of code using dplyr's "scoping" technique. Have a look at `?dplyr::scoped` and `?dplyr::summarise_all`.

* Don't worry if you don't understand this yet, as it is pretty advanced, but as you can see it gives the same output as we created in class.

```{r ch11InClass-s5-answer_v2}
sstbl <- dmx4 %>%
  select(Yij:err) %>%
  summarise_all(list(name = ~ sum(.^2)))
```

### Test Yourself Activities

#### Assignment Question 1

* The correct model for this scenario would be:

1. $Y_{ij} = \mu + A_{i} + S(A)_{ij}$

* As such the correct answer is:

```{r Q1}
mcq1 <- 1
```

[Return to Task](#Ch11AssignQueT1)

#### Assignment Question 2

The population grand mean for the shown decomposition matrix is $\hat{\mu}$ = 6

* As such the correct answer is:

```{r Q2}
mcq2 <- 2
```

[Return to Task](#Ch11AssignQueT2)

#### Assignment Question 3

The value for the shown decomposition matrix is $\hat{A}_3$ = 1

* As such the correct answer is:

```{r Q3}
mcq3 <- 3
```

[Return to Task](#Ch11AssignQueT3)

#### Assignment Question 4

The "fitted" or "typical" value for a participant in Group 1 would be $\hat{Y}_{ij}$ = $\mu$ + $A_i$

* As such the correct answer is:

```{r Q4}
Q4 <- 5
```

[Return to Task](#Ch11AssignQueT4)

#### Assignment Question 5

The participants/observations with the largest residuals are $Y_{31}$ and $Y_{32}$

* As such the correct answer is:

```{r Q5}
Q5 <- 4
```

[Return to Task](#Ch11AssignQueT5)

#### Assignment Question 6

The $SS_{total}$ for this model would be calculated as:

```{r Q6}
Q6 <- 4^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 8^2 + 2^2 + 12^2
```

* As such giving a $SS_{total}$ of `r Q6`

[Return to Task](#Ch11AssignQueT6)

#### Assignment Question 7

The $SS_{error}$ for this model would be calculated as:

```{r Q7}
Q7 <- (-1)^2 + 1^2 + (-2)^2 + 2^2 + (-5)^2 + 5^2
```

* As such giving a $SS_{error}$ of `r Q7`

[Return to Task](#Ch11AssignQueT7)

#### Assignment Question 8

From reading Miller and Haden Chapter 3, and from the inclass activity Section 5, a study with a one-factor design with GLM $Y_{ij} = \mu + A_{ij} + S(A)_{ij}$ is found to have the following SS:

* $SS_{total} = 280$, 
* $SS_{\mu} = 40$, 
* $SS_{error} = 60$.  
* $SS_{total} = SS_{\mu} + SS_{A} + SS_{error}$ 

And so:

* $SS_{A} = SS_{total} - (SS_{\mu} + SS_{error})$

Or, in other words:

* $SS_{A} = SS_{total} - SS_{\mu} - SS_{error}$


As such, given the above values and formula the value of $SS_{A}$ would be $SS_{A}$ = 180

* As such the correct answer is:

```{r Q8}
Q8 <- 180
```

#### Assignment Question 9 

Entering the following values:

- Group 1: 84, 86, 61
- Group 2: 83, 71, 95
- Group 3: 56, 95, 92
- Group 4: 68, 76, 93

`dmx` can be created as shown:

```{r decomp_mx}
dsetup <- tibble(i = rep(1:4, each = 3),
                 j = rep(1:3, times = 4),
                 Yij = NA,
                 mu = NA,
                 Ai = NA,
                 err = NA)

dmx <- dsetup %>%
  mutate(Yij = c(84, 86, 61,
                 83, 71, 95,
                 56, 95, 92,
                 68, 76, 93),
         mu = mean(Yij)) %>%
  group_by(i) %>%
  mutate(Ai = mean(Yij) - mu) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(err = Yij - (mu + Ai))
```

Producing the following output:

```{r ch11-decomp-mx-output, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(dmx,
             digits = 3,
             caption = "Decomposition Matrix of Ch11 Assignment Task 9") %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", box_css = "border: 0px;")
```

If you have set-up `dmx` correctly then you will see the below message at the bottom of your knitted html file.

**The tibble 'dmx' has been defined properly meaning that the column names (including capitalization), column data types, and tibble structure are as expected. However this does not guarantee that the values are correct and you should check these against the solution.**

```{r dmx_warning, eval = FALSE}
# Don't change anything in this code chunk; it is just here to help you check  that you've defined a table called `dmx` correctly. Pay attention to any warnings  that appear when you run this chunk. When the warning has gone away, that  means that the structure of `dmx` is correct (although it doesn't mean that the values are correct!)

if (identical(names(dmx), names(dsetup)) && 
    identical(dim(dmx), dim(dsetup))) {
  warning("The tibble 'dmx' has been defined properly meaning that the column names (including capitalization), column data types, and tibble structure are as expected. However this does not guarantee that the values are correct and you should check these against the solution.")
}
```

If however you see the below, then you need to look again at the structure of `dmx`

**You have not yet defined the tibble 'dmx' properly, and in future assignments this may affect your overall grade. Check column names (including capitalization), column data types, and table structure.**
