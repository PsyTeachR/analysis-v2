# Regression

## Overview

For the past few weeks we have been looking at designs where you have categorical factors/variables and where you want to see whether there is an effect of a given factor or an interaction between two factors on a continuous DV. And we have looked at this through decomposition matrices and through the **`afex`** package and the `aov_ez()` function. We also briefly mentioned how this approach can be extrapolated into designs with more than two factors such as three-way ANOVAs (three factors) and larger, but also into within-subject designs where every participant sees every stimuli, and mixed-designs where you have at least one between and one within factor. We will look in-depth at these different types of designs next year.

Today, however, we want to start looking at predicting relationships from continuous variables through regression. You will already be familiar with many of the terms here from your lecture series. In addition, by looking at a practical example (relating to voice research) in the lab, and by reading about regression in Miller and Haden (2013) in the PreClass, it should start to become more concrete for you.  Regression is still part of the GLM and eventually the goal will be to show you how to analyse designs that has both categorical and continuous variables as much of real data is made up like that. But for now we will just look at simple linear regression and multitple linear regression to make you more comfortable with carrying out and interpreting these analyses.

The goals of this chapter are to:

1. Introduce the concepts that underpin linear regression.
2. Demonstrate and practice carrying out and interpreting regression analysis with one or more predictor variables.
3. Demonstrate and practice being able to make predictions based on your regression model.
