# Combining ANOVA and Regression (e.g. ANCOVAs)

**Note:** This chapter looks at regression where you have one continuous IV and one categorical IV. More often than not this approach would be called an **ANCOVA**. However, it can also simply be considered as multitple regression, or the General Linear Model, as really that is what it is all about; just extended to having a mix of continuous and categorical variables.

## Overview

Over the last few weeks of the semester we have been really building up our skills on regression and on ANOVAs and now we'll focus on seeing the link between them. Most places would tell you that they are separate entities but, as you will see from the reading and activities in this lab, they are related. ANOVAs to some degree are just a special type of regression where you have **categorical** predictors. The question you probably now have is, well, if they are related, can't we merge them and combine categorical and continuous predictors in some fashion?  Yes, yes we can! And that is exactly what we are going to do today whilst learning a little bit about screen time and well-being.

The goals of this lab are:

1. to gain a conceptual understanding of how ANOVA and regression are interlinked
2. to get practical experience in analysing continuous and categorical variables in one design
3. to consolidate the wrangling skills we have learnt for the past two years
