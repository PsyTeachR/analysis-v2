## Practice Your Skills {#Ch3PracticeSkills}

In order to complete these tasks you will need to download the data .csv files and the .Rmd file, which you need to edit, titled `Ch3_PracticeSkills_Visualisations.Rmd`. These can be downloaded within a zip file from the below link. Once downloaded and unzipped, you should create a new folder that you will use as your working directory; put the data files and the .Rmd file in that folder and set your working directory to that folder through the drop-down menus at the top. [**Download the Exercises .zip file from here**](data/03-s01/Ch3_PracticeSkills_Visualisations.zip).

Now open the .Rmd file within RStudio. You will see there is a code chunk for each task. Follow the instructions on what to edit in each code chunk. This will often be entering code based on what we have covered up until this point.

Happy Data Visualising!
