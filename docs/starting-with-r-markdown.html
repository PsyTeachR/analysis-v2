<p>A key goal of any researcher is to carry out an experiment and to tell others about it. One of the main ways we as Psychologists do this is through publication of journal articles. There are numerous ways that people combine different software to create a journal article, but a more recent innovation in the field that we want you to know about is creating reports and articles through R Markdown. If you like, you can see an example from a research team in our school in this <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185093" target="_blank">recent PLOS article</a>. A link within the article methods section (this one - <a href="https://osf.io/eb9dq/" target="_blank">https://osf.io/eb9dq/</a>) allows you to see the one file that creates the whole manuscript. Obviously you won't be writing full journal articles just yet, but you will use R Markdown throughout this lab series to do assignments. You could also use it in other subjects to write reports, or to make yourself a portfolio of hints, tips, and study aids as we suggest throughout the labs.</p>
<p>Today, we will start by showing you some of skills in using R Markdown efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>In this chapter you will learn:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is R Markdown?</li>
<li>How to create an R Markdown file and knit it.</li>
<li>How to add code and edit rules in your R Markdown file.</li>
<li>How to format your text.</li>
</ol>
<div id="what-is-r-markdown" class="section level3" number="1.1.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> What is R Markdown?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-r-markdown"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>R Markdown (abbreviated as Rmd) is a great way to create dynamic documents through embedded chunks of code. These documents are self-contained and fully reproducible which makes it very easy to share. For more information about R Markdown, feel free to have a look at their main webpage sometime: <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" target="_blank">The R Markdown Webpage</a>. The key advantage of R Markdown is that it allows you to write code into a document, along with regular text, and then <strong>knit</strong> it using the package <code>knitr()</code> to create your document as either a webpage (HTML), a PDF, or Word document (.docx).</p>
<div class="webex-solution">
<button>
Explain This - We Knit what?
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
Throughout the labs you will see little tabs that give more information, answers to quick questions, helpful hints, solutions to tasks, or suggestions for information you want to note down somewhere. You do not have to read them all and you will find they get less as the course progresses, but they might help you if you are stuck on something.
</p>
<p>
Knit is what we say when we want to turn our R Markdown file into either a webpage, PDF, or a Word document. Often in the labs you will hear someone say, "Have you tried knitting it?" or "What happens when you knit it?". This simply means what happens when you try turning your file into a pdf or webpage.
</p>
<p>
For any of the practical data assignments, one check to run before submitting is to knit your code to an html (webpage) file and then see if you can open that file in your browser. This doesn't check that your code is correct. It does however confirm that your code runs and has no critical issues in it that would stop your code from running. A very valuable check.

<p>In this chapter you're going to create your own R Markdown document. Knowing how to do this will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>help you navigate R Markdown.</li>
<li>show you how to create homework assignment documents.</li>
<li>help you to create your own reports using it.</li>
</ol>
<p>If at any point you are unsure about how to do something remember to think about where you can get help, do what we do, google it (there are R markdown cheat sheets on the internet). For example, if you forget how to put words in bold, you could simply go to Google and type "<strong>rmarkdown bold</strong>" and no doubt get a lot of useful hints. There is nothing wrong with this. Nobody is expecting you to keep every function in your head; we all need reminders. You will find some elements stick in your head better than others. So remember, Google is your friend!</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: var(--green);">Quickfire Questions</span></p>
<p>We have put questions throughout to help you test your knowledge. When you type in or choose the correct answer, the dashed box will change color and become solid.</p>

Explain This Answer!
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
So there's more than one answer to this question! R Markdown can combine report writing and analysis, providing open access for others to examine data, and create more Reproducible Science. But what about the incorrect answer? R Scripts do in fact run R code as you may remember from Level 1 labs. The key difference is that R Scripts cannot really be used for documentation and creating reports as easily - this is where R Markdown is used to ensure your code can be added to all the other information of your research and can be reproduced by others.

<p>Having read the Overview for this chapter, and the reason behind using R, we are now going work on making a reproducible code. If you have a laptop, it is best to install R and Rstudio on that for you to use. In the Appendix below you will find a reminder of how to install R and Rstudio.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a new R Markdown file (.Rmd) by opening Rstudio, and then on the top menu, selecting <strong><code>File &gt;&gt; New File &gt;&gt; R Markdown...</code></strong>. You should now see the following dialog box:</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong><code>Document</code></strong> on the left-hand panel and then give your document a <strong>Title</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is your file so call it what you want but make sure it is informative to you and your reader.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put your name or your student ID in the <strong>Author</strong> field as you are the author. For now we will focus on making an <strong>HTML</strong> output, so make sure that is selected as shown in Figure <a href="starting-with-r-markdown.html#fig:img-rmarkdown-dialog">1.1</a> then hit <strong><code>OK</code></strong> when you have done so. You should now have an .Rmd file open in Rstudio.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing you will see in your R Markdown file is a header section enclosed at the top and bottom by <code>---</code>. Technically called the <strong>yaml header</strong>, this section lists the title, author, date and output format. The layout of the header is very precise and will look like that shown in Figure <a href="starting-with-r-markdown.html#fig:img-yaml-header">1.2</a>, which is currently set to output as HTML.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p>By default the file header includes the info shown in Figure <a href="starting-with-r-markdown.html#fig:img-yaml-header">1.2</a> but there are many other options available. You can learn more about this in your spare time if you like through these links for

<p>Immediately below the header information you will see the default setup <strong>code chunk</strong> as shown in Figure <a href="starting-with-r-markdown.html#fig:img-setup-chunk">1.3</a>. Most of the time, in this lab series, you will not edit the information in this <a class="glossary" target="_blank" title="A section of code in an R Markdown file" href="https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#chunk">chunk</a>. Instead, you will add information, text, code, and chunks, below this chunk.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:img-setup-chunk"></span>
<img src="images/s01-lab01/preclass/rmd_defaultchunk.png" alt="The defualt setup code chunk" width="100%"><p class="caption">
Figure 1.3: The defualt setup code chunk
</p>
</div>
<p>In RMarkdown you can type any text you want directly in the document just as you would in a word document. However, if you want to include code you need to include it in one of these <strong>code chunks</strong> similar to Figure <a href="starting-with-r-markdown.html#fig:img-setup-chunk">1.3</a>. Code chunks start with a line that contains three backwards apostrophes <strong>`</strong> (these are called grave accents - often in the top-left of QWERTY keyboards), and then a set of curly brackets with the letter r inside:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode R">```{r}</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode R">```</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You will <strong>always</strong> need both of these parts to create a code chunk:</p>
<ul>
<li>The three back ticks <strong>`</strong> are the part of the Rmd file that says this is code being inserted into my document.</li>
<li>The {r} part says that you are specifically including R code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default setup code chunk provides some basic options for your R Markdown file for when it knits your work. As above, for now, it is best to leave this particular code chunk alone. Instead we will show you how to use R Markdown by editing the code chunks that come after this default chunk.</p>
<p>The next code chunk in your file will look a bit like this:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode R">```{r cars}</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html">summary</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">cars</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode R">```</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Within the curly brackets, on the first line of the chunk, the word <code>cars</code> is included after the letter <code>r</code>. This is simply the <strong>name</strong> or the <strong>label</strong> for the code chunk and it really could have been called anything. For example, you could have called this code chunk <code>cars1</code> and a later chunk <code>cars2</code> to show it was the first and second chunk relating to cars. Whilst it is always advisable you name your code chunks, you do not need to name them. However, if you do put in names for the chunks <strong>do not use the same name twice</strong> as this will cause your script to crash when you knit it, e.g. Do not use <code>data</code> and <code>data</code>; instead maybe use <code>personality-data</code> and <code>participant-info</code> or whatever makes sense to what you are doing in the chunk. OK? Different names for different chunks! They are all individual.</p>
<div class="webex-solution">
<button>
Explain This - You can crash whilst knitting?
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
Remember knitting just means converting or rendering your file as a pdf, webpage, etc. Crashing means that you had an error in your code that stopped your knitting from working or finishing. You can usually find the problem line of code from the error message you'll see.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><br>
The second line in the above <strong>code chunk</strong> is the R code we have written: <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html">summary(cars)</a></code>. In this case, we are just asking for a <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html">summary()</a></code> of the inbuilt dataset <code>cars</code>. R has a lot of inbuilt datasets for you to practice on; <code>cars</code> is one of these.</p>
<p>The third line closes off the code chunk, again with the three backwards apostrophes. This means that whatever is contained between the first and third lines will be the code that is run.</p>
<div class="webex-solution">
<button>
Helpful Hint - Be sure to close the chunk
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
When people are first starting out using R Markdown, a common issue is code not working because they have started the code chunk correctly, but have forgotten to close it at the bottom with the three backticks. Remember, three backticks to open, three backticks to close, and in our chunk we bind them.

<p>Now would be a good time to try knitting your file to see what the code chunks do. You can do this using the <strong>Knit button</strong> at the top of the RStudio screen:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:img-the-knit-button"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>When you click <code>Knit</code> it will ask you to save the file as an .Rmd file. Call the file <code>L2Psych_Ch1_RMarkdownBasics.Rmd</code> and save it in a folder where you will keep all the information for this lab. When working in the Psychology labs or the University Library you need to save in a location or drive space that you have full access to and can save files to. The best one on campus is your <code>M:</code> drive. If using your own device then anywhere you can save the file should work. However, having a good folder structure will help you navigate the labs better.</p>

It would be very beneficial to create a folder in your <code>M:</code> drive that will contain all your data skills work for the rest of Level 2. Maybe something like <code>Psychology_Level2_DataSkills_Work</code> and then have folders within that for each lab, e.g <code>Chapter1</code>. The clearer the structure of these folders the easier it will be to find and use your files again! This is important as one thing we will keep telling you to do is <strong>LOOK BACK</strong> (politely) at what you previously did.
</p>
<p>
Couple of tips:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Avoid spaces in file names and folder names. It can make life really complicated and is a bad habit to start with. Use underscores between words in filenames and folder names.
</li>
<li>
Never call your folder "R". This will crash your R and potentially lead you to having to reinstall both R and Rstudio. When Rstudio opens it looks for a folder called R which it expects to contain the software and libraries. If they aren't there because it is now looking in a different folder with the same name, things go wrong.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><br>
After saving the file, a webpage should appear. The first thing to notice is that some lines in the code chunks have disappeared: the <code>```{r}</code> and the closing <code>```</code> in your code chunk have gone. Whenever you knit an R Markdown file these lines will disappear leaving only the code within. You'll also notice that the output of the code is also now showing in your webpage. In the next section we will show you how to control showing the output of your code, or not, through adding rules.</p>

</h3>
<p>It can often be a good idea or even necessary to show the data or the outcome of a test in your report, for example if you were writing a report and wanted to include a table of results. But what if your code displayed a table that was 10,000 lines long? In that case we might want to not show the output and only show the code. You can do this by including a rule within the first line of your code chunk - your ```{r name, rule = option} line. You have already seen a rule before in the standard default chunk, the <code>include</code> rule, but there are a number of others. Let's look at some now:</p>
<p>First, let's look at how to <strong>hide the output but show the code</strong>. Here, we use the <code>results = "hide"</code> rule:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:img-results-hide"></span>
<img src="images/s01-lab01/preclass/rmd_hide.png" alt="The results Rule" width="100%"><p class="caption">
Figure 1.6: The results Rule
</p>
</div>
<p><br><strong>Add this rule into your example code chunk, as shown above, and knit the file again. What happens?</strong> Note that there is a comma separating the name of the chunk and the rule. You should now see the code only and not the data. A key thing to note here is that your code is still "running", it just isn't showing an output. For example, say your code said <code>x &lt;- 2 + 2</code>. With the <code>results = "hide"</code> rule, you would still be running that line of code, x being assigned as 4, but you just don't see the output.
<br><br>
Alternatively, we can <strong>hide the code, but show the ouput</strong> by using the <code>echo = FALSE</code> rule:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:img-echo-hide"></span>
<img src="images/s01-lab01/preclass/rmd_echo.png" alt="The echo Rule" width="100%"><p class="caption">
Figure 1.7: The echo Rule
</p>
</div>
<p><br>
In your template Rmd file, the rule echo is set to <code>FALSE</code> meaning to show the figure and not the code. <strong>Change the rule in your code to <code>echo</code> and set it as <code>TRUE</code>, then knit the file again</strong>. What happens?</p>
<div class="webex-solution">
<button>
Explain This - Why would I hide my code?
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
Remember from Level 1 where we called in libraries to our environment. The "echo = FALSE" option is useful for commands like <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library()</a></code> when you are just calling a package into the library but don't necessarily want to display that in your final report or in your final HTML file. Another example might be if you wanted to make a plot but didn't want to include the code, you just want to show the plot in your report.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><br>
Next, say you want to <strong>hide both the code AND the output</strong> but still run the code. You can do this using the <code>include</code> rule:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:img-include-hide"></span>
<img src="images/s01-lab01/preclass/rmd_hide_both.png" alt="The include Rule" width="100%"><p class="caption">
Figure 1.8: The include Rule
</p>
</div>
<p><br><strong>Change the rule to your example code chunk, as shown above, to <code>include = FALSE</code> and then knit the file again</strong>. What happens? Note that here the code still runs. It just does not show you anything.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use the <code>eval</code> rule which specifies whether or not you want the code chunk you have written to be evaluated when you knit the RMarkdown file. Evaluated means to run or carry out the code. Here, the <code>eval = FALSE</code> rule will stop the code from being evaluated. The code will be shown because there is no rule stopping it but there will be no output because it won't get evaluated because of the <code>eval</code> rule being <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:img-eval-hide"></span>
<img src="images/s01-lab01/preclass/rmd_eval.png" alt="The eval Rule" width="100%"><p class="caption">
Figure 1.9: The eval Rule
</p>
</div>
<p><br>
This might be useful in cases where you want to show the code relating to how you programmed your stimuli for an experiment, but you don't necessarily want it to run as part of the R Markdown file.
<br><br>
We could probably do with a wee summary here:
<br></p>
<div class="inline-table"><table class="table table-sm">

<p>You can also mix and match rules to get the code/output to display as you want. It takes a little getting used to at first but if in doubt, just ask.</p>
<div class="webex-solution">
<button>
Portfolio Point - autocompletes

<div class="info">
<p>
You can use RStudio's autocomplete (the tab button) to see the different options for the different rules. For example, type <code>include =</code> and then hit the tab button on your keyboard. You should see the options of <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>.
</p>
<p>
Autocomplete also works for a lot of functions you can't quite remember how to spell as well. gg-what? gg-{tab button}... Ah yes, <code>ggplot()</code>.

<div class="webex-solution">

Explain This - I don't understand these answers
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
The first answer should be <code>results = "hide"</code> as you want to show the code and run the code but not necessarily show the output of the code.
</p>
<p>
In the second question, <code>include = FALSE</code> technically would hide the code, but this also hides the output! <code>echo = FALSE</code> allows you to still see your plot while hiding the code you want hidden. <code>code = HIDE</code> - if only it were that simple!
</p>

<li>True or False, writing <code>echo = TRUE</code> has the same effect on the output of a code chunk as if you had no echo rule at all: <select class="webex-select"><option value="blank"></option>
<option value="answer">TRUE</option>
<option value="">FALSE</option></select>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="webex-solution">
<button>
Explain This - Echo True or Not at all
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
All of the code chunk rules have a default option. For example, <code>echo</code>, <code>include</code>, and <code>eval</code> are usually by default set to <code>TRUE</code>. As a result, if you don't set any <code>echo</code> rule, i.e. you don't specifically set <code>echo = FALSE</code> in your code chunk, then it is the same as setting <code>echo = TRUE</code>. So not specifying an option will give you the default setting for that option.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>True or False, there is no difference between setting <code>results = "hide"</code> and <code>eval = FALSE</code> as they both hide the output: <select class="webex-select"><option value="blank"></option>
<option value="">TRUE</option>
<option value="answer">FALSE</option></select>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="webex-solution">
<button>
Explain This - What's the difference?
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
With setting <code>results = "hide"</code>, the code is evaluated and results are produced but the output is hidden. With setting <code>eval = FALSE</code>, the code is not evaluated and therefore no results or output have been produced. If you need your output for a later part of the code then you would might use <code>results = "hide"</code>. If you don't need the output and just want to show the code as an example then you might use <code>eval = FALSE</code>.

</h3>
<p>An alternative way to add code to a report is through what is called using <strong>inline code</strong>. With inline code you don't use a code chunk. Instead the code appears <strong>inline</strong> with the text. Inline code can be inserted using a back-tick, then the letter <code>r</code>, followed by a space, then the code you want to include, then finally another back-tick. For example, writing <code>`r 2 + 2`</code> would return the answer <strong>4</strong> when you knit the file instead of showing the code. Remember, you do not do this inside a code chunk, you do this in line with your text, e.g.:
<br><br><strong>"We ran <code>`r 2+2`</code> people".</strong>
<br><br>
Which when knitted becomes:
<br><br><strong>"We ran 4 people".</strong></p>
<p>So inline coding is really useful if you want to do calculations <strong>within your text</strong> or insert values into text, say from a dataframe, to make an informative sentence. We will look at more complex examples later in the labs but again this is a really useful tool for writing manuscripts through R Markdown the more comfortable you get with it.</p>

</h3>
<p>The last thing we want to show you in this preclass activity is how to format your text.</p>
<p>When you're not writing in code chunks you can format your document in lots of different ways just like you would in a Word document (or other expensive license-based software). The <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank">R Markdown cheatsheet</a> provides lots of information about how to do this but we will show you a couple of things that you might want to try out.</p>
<p>We can make text <strong>bold</strong> by including two ** (two asterisks) at the start and end of the text we want to present in bold font. For example:
<br><br>
"We ran **4 people**.
<br><br>
Which when knitted becomes:
<br><br>
"We ran <strong>4 people</strong>".
<br><br><strong>Now write some text in your Rmd file and put it in bold.</strong> Knit the file to check it worked.</p>
<p>You could also try using italics by putting a single * (asterisk) at the start and end of the word or sentence. <strong>Try this now.</strong> Here is an example to help.
<br><br>
"We ran *4 people*.
<br><br>
Which when knitted becomes:
<br><br>
"We ran <em>4 people</em>".
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> italics can be difficult to read for many people and as such we have tried to avoid using it in this book. If you find some italics, where it is not necessary, please let us know and claim your reward of a packet of minstrels. Yes, a whole packet!</p>
<p>Finally, you might want to add headings and sub-headings to your file. For example, maybe you are writing a Psychology journal article and want to put in a header for the Introduction, Methods, Results, or Discussion sections. We do this using the # (hashtag) symbol as shown in Figure <a href="starting-with-r-markdown.html#fig:img-header-levels">1.10</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:img-header-levels"></span>

Figure 1.10: Inputting different Header levels using #s
</p>
</div>
<p><br><strong>Now, type the four main sections found in a Psychology journal article in your R Markdown file, typing each one in a separate line</strong>. These are mentioned above. Knit the file. What do these look like?</p>
<p><strong>Now add a different number of #'s before each heading</strong>, with a space between the heading and the hashtag (e.g. # Introduction) and knit the file again. What do you notice about the different number of hashtags?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: var(--green);">Quickfire Questions</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If * puts words into italics, and ** puts words into bold, type in the box what might you put before (and technically after) a word to put it into italics with bold? <input class="webex-solveme nospaces" size="3" data-answer='["***"]'></p></li>
<li><p>True or False: The <strong>more</strong> '#'s you include, the <strong>smaller</strong> the header is: <select class="webex-select"><option value="blank"></option>
<option value="answer">TRUE</option>
<option value="">FALSE</option></select></p></li>
<li><p>From the options, the most common order of headings found in a Psychology Journal are: <select class="webex-select"><option value="blank"></option>
<option value="">Discussion, Introduction, Methods, Results</option>
<option value="">Discussion, Results, Methods, Introduction</option>
<option value="answer">Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion</option>
<option value="">Introduction, Results, Methods, Discussion</option></select></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="webex-solution">
<button>
Explain This - I don't get these answers
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
If * at the start and end of the word puts it in italics (e.g. <em>italics</em>) and ** puts it in bold (e.g. <strong>bold</strong>), then putting three *** at the start and end will put it in italics with bold (e.g. <strong><em>italics-bold</em></strong>).
</p>
<p>
It is true that the more #'s you use, the smaller the heading is. Word and other document writers use different headings as well. Here, # gives the biggest heading, and it gets smaller and smaller with every extra #.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in Psychology, the vast majority of journal articles are written in the format of: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion. This format does not always hold as some journals ask authors to use a different format, depending how much emphasis that journal (erroneously) likes to put on results over hypothesis and methods. We however teach the order stated above. The question and approach is always as important, if not more so, than the results! Which of course you know from learning about Registered Reports in the labs and lectures.

<p>We are going to create a R Markdown from scratch. This is also a start to create your own <strong>Experimental Design and Analysis Portfolio</strong> through R Markdown. The aim of this portfolio is to consolidate your learning in experimental design and analysis, allowing you to reflect back on how your learning has progressed. You should add to it whenever you think "Oh that is a good tip!" or "That is something I want to remember!". Do this each chapter as a way to consolidate knowledge. Your portfolio is for you and will not be assessed or marked in anyway. It is your learning aid to help you develop your understanding of research methods and analysis in Psychology.</p>
<p>Across the following nine tasks, we will help you to structure and format R Markdown files; you can then apply what you learn here to your portfolio in your own time. Let's begin!</p>

<p>The activities in this chapter will make use of an <strong>open dataset</strong>.</p>
<div class="webex-solution">
<button>
Explain This - What is an open dataset?
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
An open dataset is made available for everyone to see and is stored on the internet for other researchers to use. In the previous section, you saw an example of this at the very start in the PLOS One article. Many journals now ask researchers to make their data available or to post it somewhere accessible like the <a href="https://www.osf.io" target="_blank">Open Science Framework</a>.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, the art of making your data available was standard in classic older articles. The data we are using today comes from 1967. Sometime between then and more recent times, data started being made unavailable - closed. We believe all data should be made available and will encourage you to do that over the coming years. Transparent science is Open Science!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><br>
The data we will use today is from a paper looking at the <strong>Ponzo illusion</strong> and Age:</p>
<p><strong>Leibowitz, H. W. &amp; Judisch, J. M. (1967). The Relation between Age and the Magnitude of the Ponzo Illusion. The American Journal of Psychology, 80(1), 105-109.</strong> It can be accessed on campus (University of Glasgow) through <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1420548?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">this link</a>. Off campus you can sign in to read it through the University of Glasgow library if you are a student at Glasgow.</p>
<p>The basics of the Ponzo illusion (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzo_illusion" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>) is that two lines of the same size are viewed as being of different length based on surrounding information - like sleepers on a traintrack. See Figure 1 of Leibowitz and Judisch (1967) for an example (P106). The authors showed people two vertical lines surrounded by differing horizontal lines running at angles behind the main vertical lines. The authors varied the size of one of the vertical lines (left line) and asked the participants to judge which of the two vertical lines was bigger or longer; the left line (variable) or the right one (standard). The paper also tested how this illusion was influenced by age. For more info, see the paper. Operationalising the dependent variable, Leibowitz &amp; Judisch measured what size the left line had to be to be considered the same size as the standard line on the right. The data we will be using can be seen on page 107, and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which Group participants were assigned to according to age, with each group being made of 10 participants of the same sex</li>
<li>The Sex of the Group</li>
<li>The Mean Age of the Group</li>
<li>The Mean Length of the left vertical line</li>

You can now remove the parts of the generic R Markdown code that we do not need; anything <strong>after</strong> the <code>setup</code> code chunk can be removed (see Figure <a href="starting-with-r-markdown.html#fig:img-setup-chunk">1.3</a>). So anything after line 11 can be removed. Leave the first code chunk however - lines 8 to 10 - as these lines make R Markdown show code chunks unless otherwise specified - note the <code>echo =  TRUE</code>.</p>

Portfolio Point - Set Working Directory
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
One of the most common issues we see with people using Rstudio is that they forget to set their working directory to the folder containing the data file they are working on. This means that when you try to knit or run a code line it won't work because Rstudio doesn't know where the data is. Remember to set your working directory at the start of each session, using <strong><code>Session &gt;&gt; Set Working Directory &gt;&gt; Choose Directory</code></strong>
</p>
<p>
Avoid using code to set your working directory as often this will only work on your machine and not others and is therefore not fully reproducible without editing the script.

<li>Copy and paste the code below into your code chunk. Spend a couple of minutes with a partner reminding yourself what the code does. The answer is in the hint below.</li>

Helpful Hint - What was all that?
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
<strong>Hints:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Step 4 - echo can equal TRUE or FALSE.
</li>
<li>
Remember to separate rules in the code chunk with commas. E.g. {r, rule1 = FALSE, rule2 = TRUE}
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>What does the code do?</strong>
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
Line 1 loads the <code>tidyverse</code> packages and all associated packages e.g. <code>dplyr</code>, <code>readr</code> and <code>ggplot2</code>. You have used these in Level 1 Grassroots book - we will recap a lot of that in the coming labs.<br>
</li>
<li>
Line 2 loads in the data using the <code>read_csv()</code> function and stores it in <code>ponzo_data</code>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Important points to note:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>ponzo_data</code> could have been called anything but best to call it something that makes it clear what it is. Only rule is no spaces in the name. <code>ponzo_data</code> and <code>ponzo.data</code> are acceptable, and different from each other. <code>ponzo data</code> is not acceptable and will crash the code.
</li>
<li>
<code>read_csv()</code> is actually in the <code>readr</code> package and is available to you only after you have loaded in <code>tidyverse</code> through <code><a href="https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org">library(tidyverse)</a></code>. We will <strong>always</strong> tell you to use <code>read_csv()</code> to read in data from a csv file. There are other codes that load in data - one very similar one is <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/read.table.html">read.csv()</a></code>. They work differently. Only ever use <code>read_csv()</code> in your Psychology labs unless otherwise instructed.
</li>
<li>
remember <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">&lt;-</a></code> essentially means <code>assign this to that</code>. Assigning the ponzo data to the table <code>ponzo_data</code> can actually can be written the other way around - <code>read_csv("PonzoAgeData.csv") -&gt; ponzo_data</code> - but convention usually puts it the way we have in the code.

<div class="info">
<p>
Lists can be tricky to begin with but are very straightforward once you know the key points.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The list begins after a blank line after any text. If you start the list without leaving a blank line at the top it won't work.
</li>
<li>
Each point starts with an asterisk (*) or by an integer and full-stop (e.g. <code>1.</code>)
</li>
<li>
You must have a space after the * or 1. before writing your point.
</li>
<li>
Each point is a new line.

To stagger points on a list (i.e. indent), leave 4 blank spaces (two tabs) and then put your * etc.

<!-- Those questions about citations may throw you a little. In late 2019, the APA Style Guide 7th edition was released. One of the biggest changes here was that for papers of three or more authors, the citation would only show the first author and the year, as opposed to listing all authors on first citation. Two author papers and single author papers still always show all authors.

Portfolio Point - A good methods section
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
Remember that a good methods section will contain all the necessary information that would be required for another researcher to replicate your experiment exactly! It would normally be split into three sections including Participants, Materials, and Procedure.
</p>
<p>
This may sound very obvious but you would be surprised at how many Methods sections don't give enough information for replicating the study. Articles tend to have word counts - just like your assignments. Authors have tended to cut words where they can to fit in further discussion or more results. Methods sections have suffered as a result. But no more!

Portfolio Point - To assign or to not assign
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
You may notice above that we assigned our data in the table to <code>my_table</code> and then called <code>my_table</code> to show it. However, we didn't do that for the figure. We just put the code for the figure but did not assign it. Why?
</p>
<p>
There is no great answer and you could assign both or not assign either, and we will chop and change throughout the labs to show you the difference but the tendency is to assign tables but not assign figures. Simply because we often are creating the figures to show them and therefore assigning them and then calling them requires more code. Tables on the other hand are often stored to work on later, so it makes sense to assign them.
</p>
<p>
Again this is not a hard and fast rule and often we will assign figures but it just makes it quicker not to. If you ever do assign a figure remember to call it, or your figure won't be displayed!

Portfolio Point - The Power of R Markdown and the ggplot Package
</button>
<div class="info">
<p>
Here is a real-world scenario of why plotting in R Markdown can save a lot of effort. Say you carried out an experiment, made a figure of the results using an R Script, and wrote up the report using Microsoft Word. Then you realised you forgot to include two participants. To fix this, you would have to re-run the R script, make a new plot, save the plot, and <strong>then</strong> transfer that to your Word document. However, had you used <strong>R Markdown</strong> to begin with and both analysis and report were in the same place, then you can simply update the code within the document and a new figure will be created in the exact same place as the old one. <strong>Magic!</strong>
</p>
<p>
The code above uses the <code>ggplot2</code> package you used before. This is the main package we use for plots, figures, visualisations, or however you like to call them. It can be called into the library by itself, or is automatically called in when you call in the <code>tidyverse</code> package. Later, we will revist <code>ggplot2</code> in more detail. For now, we are using it to make a scatterplot (<code>geom_point</code>) of Age (<code>Mean_Age</code>) and Comparison Length (<code>ComparisonLength</code>), and splitting the data for males and females.
