## Data Wrangling Application



We looked at a series of functions known as the Wickham six one-table to `filter`, `arrange`, `group_by`, `select`, `mutate` and `summarise`. Now we will focus on working with data across two or more tables using functions you will have come across in the <a href="https://psyteachr.github.io/" target = "_blank">Data Skills book</a>. The two main functions we will add to the Wickham six are `pivot_longer()` and `inner_join()`.

* `pivot_longer()` allows us to **transform** a table from wide format to long format.


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explain this - Wide format vs long format</button>

<div class="info">
<p>We use <code>Tidy Data</code> because it is really efficient and
works well with the <code>tidyverse</code>. However, people used to use
data structured in <code>long</code> format or <code>wide</code>
format.</p>
<p>Long format is where each <strong>row</strong> is a single
observation, typically a single trial in an experiment or a response to
a single item on a questionnaire. When you have multiple trials per
participant, you will have multiple rows for the same participant. To
identify participants, you would need a variable with some kind of
participant id, which can be as simple as a distinct integer value for
each participant. In addition to the participant identifier, you would
have any measurements taken during each observation (e.g., response
time) and what experimental condition the observation was taken
under.</p>
<p>In wide format data, each <strong>row</strong> corresponds to a
single participant, with multiple observations for that participant
spread across columns. So for instance, with survey data, you would have
a separate column for each survey question.</p>
<p><code>Tidy</code> is a mix of both of these approaches and most
functions in the tidyverse assume the tidy format, so typically the
first thing you need to do when you get data, particularly wide-format
data, is to reshape it through wrangling. Which is why we teach these
really important skills.</p>
</div>

</div>


* `inner_join()` allows us to **combine** two tables together based on common columns.

**Analysing the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)**

To continue building your data wrangling skills we will recap on skills from the Data Skills book by tidying up data from the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) questionnaire. If you have completed the <a href="https://psyteachr.github.io/" target = "_blank">Data Skills book</a> then you may be familiar with the AQ10; a non-diagnostic short form of the AQ with only 10 questions per participant. It is a discrete scale and the higher a participant scores on the AQ10 the more autistic-like traits they are said to display. Anyone scoring 7 or above is recommended for further diagnosis. You can see an example of the AQ10 through this link: <a href="http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/tests/AQ10.pdf" target = "_blank">AQ10 Example</a>. 

We have four data files to work with: 

* `responses.csv` containing the AQ survey responses to each of the 10 questions for our 66 participants
* `qformats.csv` containing information on how a question should be coded, i.e. forward or reverse coded
* `scoring.csv` containing information on how many points a specific response should get; depending on whether it is forward or reverse coded 
* `pinfo.csv` containing participant information such as Age, Sex and importantly `ID` number. 


[Click here to download](data/02-s01/inclass/ch2-inclass-data.zip) the files as a zip file. Now unzip the files into a folder you have access to.


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Good to Know - Open Data is best in .csv format</button>

<div class="info">
<p><code>csv</code> stands for ‘comma separated values’ and is a very
basic format for storing data in a plain text file. It really just
stores numbers and text separated by commas and nothing else. The great
thing about being this basic is that it can be read by many different
systems and is non-proprietary, i.e., you don’t need to purchase
commercial software to open it.</p>
</div>

</div>

<br>

Now **set your working directory** to the folder where you saved the `.csv` files. Do this through the dropdown menus at the top toolbar: `Session >> Set Working Directory >> Choose Directory` and then find your folder with your `.csv` files. 

Today we will work in an RScript instead of .Rmd, but if you want to turn it into an R Markdown report or add elements to your Portfolio then please feel free.

<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: var(--pink);">Thinking Cap Point</span>

Now would be a good time to make sure that you are all using RStudio effectively and know what each window does. 

* TRUE or FALSE, the Console is best for practice and the Script window is for saving: <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>
* TRUE or FALSE, the Environment holds all the data and objects you have loaded in and created: <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>
* TRUE or FALSE, clicking the name of a table in the Environment window will open it in the Script window: <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explain this - Answers to Thinking Cap questions</button>

<div class="info">
<p>The answer to all of these are True.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The Script window is where you should write code and comments
that you are going to save and send to people. The Console is where you
should practice stuff - nothing is saved here; it is like a sandbox that
just gets wiped away.</p></li>
<li><p>Any data you load in or create is held in the Environment (or
Global Environment) window with the variable name that you gave
it.</p></li>
<li><p>By clicking the name of the table in the Environment window it
will open up in the Script window and you can look at it to make sure it

</ol>
</div>

</div>


### Task 1: Open a Script

1. Start a new RScript and save it in the same folder as your .csv files, calling the RScript something informative like `AQ_DataWrangling.R`.
2. Make sure your environment is completely empty so we don't mix up one analysis with the other. You can run the following code line in the console to clear the environment or by clicking the little brush on your environment window.


```r
rm(list = ls()) 
```
 

<div class='webex-solution'><button>Good to Know - Comments on scripts and running lines</button>

<div class="info">
<p>Remember that when using a script you can write notes to yourself to
remind you what a line of code does. Just put a hashtag at the start of
the line and R will ignore this line. This is where you have to be clear
on using a Script versus an R Markdown file. In a Script, # means the
line is ignored, in Markdown # sets the line as a header!.</p>
<p>To run any line on a script, the simplest way is to click anywhere on
that line and either press Run on the top of the script window or press
CTRL+Enter on the keyboard (or mac equivalent).</p>
</div>

</div>


### Task 2: Bring in Your Library {#Ch2InClassQueT2}

1. Add a line to your code that brings the `tidyverse` package into your working environment and run it.


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Helpful Hint - Library vs Install</button>

<div class="info">
<p>Combine the function <code>library()</code> and the package
<code>tidyverse</code> and remember that the solutions are at the end of
the chapter.</p>
<p>On our lab machines in Psychology all the necessary packages will
already be on the machines, they just need called into the library. If
however you are using your own machine you will have to install the
packages first (and you only have to do this once).</p>
<p>Do not install packages on the Psychology machines! Why?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>They are already installed and can cause the package to stop working
if a student tries to install the same package on our machines.</li>
<li>They are already installed and it is a bit like using apps on your
phone. Install is putting the app onto your phone, library is just
opening the app. If you’ve already downloaded the app (package) then you
just need to open it (<code>library()</code>) to use it!</li>
</ol>
</div>

</div>


### Task 3: Load in the Data {#Ch2InClassQueT3}

Now we have to load in the `.csv` datafiles using the `read_csv()` function and save them as tibbles in our environment. For example, to load in the data in `responses.csv` and save it as the tibble `responses` we would type:


```r
responses <- read_csv("responses.csv") 
```

1. Add the following lines of code to your script and complete them to load in all four `.csv` datafiles. Use the above code as an example and name each tibble the same as its original filename (minus the .csv part), again as above, e.g. `responses.csv` gets saved as `responses`. Remember to run the lines so that the data is loaded in and stored in your environment. 


```r
responses <-  read_csv()    # survey responses
qformats <-                 # question formats
scoring <-                  # scoring info
pinfo <-                    # participant information
```


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Good to Know - Use read_csv</button>

<div class="info">
<p>As you work with data and functions you will find there are functions
with similar names, but that give different results. One of these is the
<code>read</code> function for <code>csv</code>. Make sure to
<strong>always</strong> use <code>read_csv()</code> as your function to
load in <code>csv</code> files. Nothing else. It is part of the
<code>readr</code> package automatically brought in with
<code>tidyverse</code>.</p>
<p>There is a very similarly named function called
<code>read.csv()</code>. DO NOT use this function. We will always expect
you to use <code>read_csv()</code>. Although very similar in name they
do not work the same way and create differences in your data.</p>
</div>

</div>


### Task 4: Review Your Data. {#Ch2InClassQueT4}

Now that we have the data loaded in it is always best to have a look at the data to get an idea of its layout. We showed you one way before, by clicking on the name in the environment, but you can also use the `glimpse()` or `View()` functions in your Console window. Put the name of the data between the brackets to see how it is arranged. Don't add these to your script though - they are just one-offs for testing.

Have a look at the data in `responses` to see if you think it is Tidy or not and answer the following question: The data in `responses` is in <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Tidy</option><option value=''>Long</option><option value='answer'>Wide</option></select> format


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explain This - I don't get why?</button>

<div class="info">
<p>The <code>reponses</code> tibble is far from being tidy; each row
represents multiple observations from the same participant, i.e., each
row shows responses to multiple questions -
<code>wide format</code>.</p>
</div>

</div>
  

### Task 5: Gathering Data with pivot_longer(). {#Ch2InClassQueT5}

In order to make it easier for us to get the AQ score for each participant, we need to change the layout of the `responses` tibble from its wide format to a long format using the `pivot_longer()` function. 

1. Copy the below code line to your script and run it.


```r
rlong <- pivot_longer(responses,
                      cols = Q1:Q10,
                      names_to = "Question",
                      values_to = "Response")
```

Let's look at the code in detail:

* The first argument given to the `pivot_longer()` function is the tibble which holds the data we want to wrangle, `responses`. 
    - Remember we could have written this with a pipe as well, e.g. `rlong <- responses %>% pivot_longer(...)`
* The second argument is the names of specific columns in the original tibble that we want to gather together, `Q1:Q10` meaning all columns between Q1 and Q10.
    - You do not actually need to write `cols = ` but it makes things clearer.
    - "Gathering" of columns is based on position in the tibble.  If the order of columns in the tibble was Q1 then Q10, the above code would only gather those two columns. As it is, in our tibble, the order, is Q1, Q2, Q3, ... Q10, and therefore the code gathers all the columns between Q1 and Q10.  
    - Column names are not put in quotes because they exist already in the tibble `responses`.
* The third and fourth arguments are the names of the new columns we are creating; 
    - The first will store the question numbers, `Question`. I.e. put the question names (`names_to = ...`) in a column called "Question". 
    - The second will store the values/responses, `Response`. I.e. put the values/responses to the questions (`values_to = ...`) in a column called "Response".
    - These new column names are put in quotes because they do not already exist in the tibble. This is not always the case, but is the case for this function.
    - Note that these names could have been anything but by using these names the code makes more sense.
    - Lastly, you do need to write `names_to = ...` and `values_to = ...` otherwise the columns won't be created correctly.

In case you are wondering, if we wanted to go back the way and ungather the data we just gathered, we would use the `pivot_wider()` function: e.g. `rwide <- rlong %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Question, values_from = Response)`. But we do not want to do that here so let's not add this to the code. 

<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: var(--green);">Quickfire Questions</span>

Let's see if you understand `pivot_longer()`. Say you wanted to gather the first three columns of `responses` (Q1, Q2, Q3), put the question numbers in a column called `Jam`, the responses in a column called `Strawberry`, and store everything in a tibble called `sandwich`. Fill in the box with what you would write: <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='90' data-answer='["sandwich <- pivot_longer(responses, cols = Q1:Q3, names_to = \"Jam\", values_to = \"Strawberry\")"]'/>


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explain this - I don't get the right answer!</button>

<div class="info">
<p><code>sandwich &lt;- pivot_longer(responses, cols = Q1:Q3, names_to = "Jam", values_to = "Strawberry")</code></p>
<p><code>pivot_longer()</code> wants the data first, then the columns to
gather, then the name of the new column to store the gathered column
names in, and finally the name of the new column to store the values
in.</p>
</div>

</div>


### Task 6: Combining Data. {#Ch2InClassQueT6}

So now our `responses` data is in tidy format, we are closer to getting an AQ score for each person. However, we still need to add some information to:

* show if the question is reverse or forward scored - found in `qformats`
* show the number of points to give a specific response - found in `scoring`. 

This is a typical analysis situation where different information is in different tables and you need to join them together. Both these pieces of information are contained in `qformats` and `scoring`, respectively, but we want to join it to the data in `rlong` to create one informative tidy table with all the info. 

We can do this sort of join through the function `inner_join()`; a function to combine information in two tibbles using a column (or columns) common to both tibbles.

1. Copy the below line into your code and run it. This piece of code combines rows in the tibble `rlong` with rows in the tibble `qformats`, based on the common column "Question".


```r
rlong2 <- inner_join(rlong, qformats, "Question")
```

2. Now have a look in `rlong2`. We have matched each question with its scoring format, `forward` or `reverse`.


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Portfolio Point - Reverse and Forward</button>

<div class="info">
<p>A lot of questionnaires have some questions that are Forward scored
and some questions that are Reverse scored. What does this mean? Imagine
a situation where your options in replying to a question are: 1 -
extremely agree, 2 - agree, 3 - neutral, 4 - disagree, 5 - extremely
disagree. In a forward-scoring question you would get 1 point for
extremely agree, 2 for agree, 3 for neutral, etc. In a reverse scoring
question, you would get 5 for extremely agree, 4 for agree, 3 for
neutral, etc.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this shift is that sometimes agreeing or
disagreeing might be more favourable depending on how the question is
worded. Secondly, sometimes these questions are used just to catch
people out - imagine if you had two similar questions where one has the
reverse meaning of the other. In this scenario, people should respond
opposites. If they respond the same then they might not be paying
attention.</p>
</div>

</div>
  
<br>

Now we need to combine the information in our table, `rlong2`, with the `scoring` table so we know how many points to attribute each question based on the answer the participant gave, and whether the question was forward or reverse coded. Again, we use the `inner_join()` function, but this time the common columns found in `rlong2` and `scoring` are `QFormat` and `Response`. To combine by two columns you just write them in sequence as shown below. **Note: when there is more than one common column between two tibbles you are joining, you should combine by ALL the columns to avoid repeat columns in the new tibble.** If you forget to do this, your new tibble will have names such as `column_name.x` and `column_name.y`. This will cause confusion so avoid it by combining by all common columns.

3. Copy the below line into your code and run it. This code combine rows in `rlong2` and `scoring` based on the columns, `QFormat` and `Response`.


```r
rscores <- inner_join(rlong2, scoring, c("QFormat", "Response"))
```

### Task 7: Calculating the AQ Scores.  {#Ch2InClassQueT7}

We have now created `rscores` which has information on how each participant responded to each question and how each question should be coded and scored, all within the one tibble. All we need now is to sum the scores for each participant to get their AQ score. 

1. Based on what you learning in the previous section, copy the below line into your code and complete it to obtain individual `aq_scores` for each participant.  
2. Save your script and run it all again from the start to make sure it works!


```r
aq_scores <- rscores %>% 
             group_by() %>% # how will you group individual participants?
             summarise(AQ = sum()) # which column will you sum to obtain AQ scores?
```


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Helpful Hint</button>

<div class="info">
<ul>
<li>Each participant could be grouped by their Id.</li>
<li>If we summed up the value for each Score we might get a full AQ
Score for each particpipant.</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
  


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Portfolio Points - Hang on isn't that a Pipe?</button>

<div class="info">
<p>Yep, well spotted. Pipes are your friend. Think of them as saying
‘and then’ or ‘goes into’. So in the example above we take
<code>rscores</code> and then group it by something and then summarise
it into AQ scores based on…</p>
<p>In most cases, the pipe serves the purpose of putting the input into
the function or taking the output of one function and treating it as the
input of another function.</p>
<p>In the example above the first pipe takes <code>rscores</code> as the
input for <code>group_by</code>, and the second pipe takes the output of
<code>group_by</code> and puts it as the input to
<code>summarise</code>. See how you can almost read it as a chain of
actions or steps.</p>
</div>

</div>
  
<br>

<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: var(--green);">Quickfire Questions</span>

The whole purpose of this chapter was to calculate AQ scores for individual participants. Try to answer the following questions. Try to do it using code where possible to help you based on your knowledge from the this chapter. Remember the cheatsheets as well. Look for the `dplyr` one! 

1. From the options, choose the correct citation for the AQ 10 question questionnaire: <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Allison, Auyeung, and Baron-Cohen, (2011)</option><option value='answer'>Allison, Auyeung, and Baron-Cohen, (2012)</option><option value=''>Allison and Baron-Cohen, (2012)</option><option value=''>Auyeung, Allison, and Baron-Cohen, (2012)</option></select>  

2. Complete the sentence, the higher the AQ score...<select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>the less autistic-like traits displayed</option><option value=''>has no relation to autistic-like traits</option><option value='answer'>the more autistic-like traits displayed</option></select>  

3. Type in the AQ score (just the number) of Participant ID No. 87: <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='10' data-answer='["2"]'/>  

4. Type how many participants had an AQ score of 3 (again just the number): <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='10' data-answer='["13"]'/>  

5. The cut-off for the AQ10 is usually said to be around 6 meaning that anyone with a score of more than 6 should be referred for diagnostic assessment. Type in how many participants we should refer from our sample: <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='10' data-answer='["6"]'/>  


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explain This - I don't get these answers</button>

<div class="info">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>From the link above you can see that an appropriate citation for

<li><p><code>filter(aq_scores, AQ &gt; 6) %&gt;% count()</code> or
<code>filter(aq_scores, AQ &gt;= 7) %&gt;% count()</code>. The answer is

</ol>
</div>

</div>
  

### Task 8: Practice using pipes {#Ch2InClassQueT8}

You now have a complete code to load in your data, convert it to Tidy, combine the tables and calculate an AQ score for each participant. But, if you look at it, some of your code could be more efficient by using pipes. 

Go back through your code and rewrite it using pipes `%>%` so that it is as efficient as possible. 


<div class='webex-solution'><button>Helpful Hint</button>

<div class="info">
<p>At any point where the first argument of your function is the name of
a variable created before that line, there is a good chance you could
have used a pipe! Here are all the bits of this code that could be piped
together into one chain:</p>
<p><code>rlong &lt;- pivot_longer(responses, cols = Q1:Q10, names_to = "Question", values_to = "Response")</code></p>
<p><code>rlong2 &lt;- inner_join(rlong, qformats, "Question")</code></p>
<p><code>rscores &lt;- inner_join(rlong2, scoring, c("QFormat", "Response"))</code></p>
<p><code>aq_scores &lt;- rscores %&gt;% group_by(Id) %&gt;% summarise(AQ = sum(Score))</code></p>
