## InClass Comparison



This section shows the output that would be expected if you were to follow the inclass activities correctly.

* **Note:** Headings in this comparison will appear one size smaller than if you were to knit the Rmd due to rendering. Do not worry if yours look a bit bigger, it is more that you have them as **headers** is the key part.Your output should match the output of knitting [the .Rmd document found here](data/01-s01/inclass/ProducedPonzoTemplate.zip)
