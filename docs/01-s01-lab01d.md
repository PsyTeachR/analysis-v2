## Practice Your Skills

This is a brief exercise for you to practice the skills taught in this chapter. In future assignments we will ask you to do some coding and interpretation, but for this exercise we just want you to familiarise yourself again with working with .Rmd files.

We have set up this task so that you can practice 1) downloading the assignment files, 2) renaming the files, 3) editing the .Rmd file, and 4) saving the edited .Rmd file. 

**Download the files**

You will first need to download the file from the zip folder on Moodle and then open it in R through RStudio. For this exercise, you can also download [the ZIP file here](data/01-s01/GUID_L2_Ch1_PracticeSkills.zip).

Simply follow the instructions in the .Rmd document that you will find in the ZIP file. Enjoy!
