## Solutions to Questions

Below you will find the solutions to the questions for the Activities for this chapter. Only look at them after giving the questions a good try and speaking to the tutor about any issues.

<!-- ### InClass Activities -->

### Task 2: Give your Report a Heading

1. You should have used only one hashtag to give the biggest heading size.

`# Lab 1 - The magnitude of the Ponzo Illusion varies as a function of Age`

[Return to Task](#Ch1InClassQueT2)

### Task 3: Creating a Code Chunk

1. The `echo` rule, `warning` rule and `message` rule should all be set to `FALSE`. As such, the start of the code chunk should look like:

<div class='verbatim'><pre class='sourceCode r'><code class='sourceCode R'>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r load_data, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}</code></pre><pre class='sourceCode r'><code class='sourceCode R'>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code></pre></div>

### Task 4: Writing your Report

1. Task 4 is about setting a title to `Header 2` style. This is done via two `##` at the start of the line - before the word Introduction in this case but don't forget the space. 

`## Introduction`

**Worth noting:** In basic R Scripts, `#` at the start of the line would result in turning the line into a <a class='glossary' target='_blank' title='You can annotate .R files or chunks in R Markdown files with comments by prefacing each line of the comment with one or more hash symbols (#).' href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#comment'>comment</a>. Here, in R Markdown,  `#` sets the header size much like a Word document header

2. For the second part, create an ordered list by putting `1` followed by a `.` then a space before the first piece of information. A `2` then a `.` before the second, and so on. Note that lists will only work if there is a empty line above the list as well:

```
1. The Perspective Hypothesis
2. The Framing Hypothesis
```

### Task 5: Making Text Bold or Italicized

1. To turn text to bold you need to put two `**` at the start and end of the word or sentence you want as bold, e.g.

```
**make me bold**
```

### Task 6: Adding Links to the Data in your Methods

1. To set a header as `Header 2` style use `##` at the start of the line.
2. To set a header as `Header 3` style use `###` at the start of the line.
3. A link is created by putting the words you want to act as the link between `[]` and then the link immediately after in `()`. For example:

```
[Lebowitz and Judisch (2016)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1420548?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
```

### Task 7: Adding an Image to your Methods

1. To set a header as `Header 3` style use `###` at the start of the line.
2. An image is created by putting the words you want to act as the name of the image `[]` and then the link to the image immediately after in `()`. The key thing is to start with an exclamation mark `!`. For example:

```
![name](link)
```

and therefore

```

```

### Task 8: Adding a Table to your Results

1. To set a header as `Header 2` style use `##` at the start of the line.

2. The code chunk heading should read as follows:

<div class='verbatim'><pre class='sourceCode r'><code class='sourceCode R'>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r table, echo = FALSE}</code></pre><pre class='sourceCode r'><code class='sourceCode R'>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code></pre></div>

[Return to Task](#Ch1InClassQueT8)

### Task 9: Adding a Figure to your Results

1. The code chunk heading should read as follows:

<div class='verbatim'><pre class='sourceCode r'><code class='sourceCode R'>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r plot, include = TRUE}</code></pre><pre class='sourceCode r'><code class='sourceCode R'>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code></pre></div>

### Example of output after completing all activities



This section shows the output that would be expected if you were to follow the inclass activities correctly.

* **Note:** Headings in this comparison will appear one size smaller than if you were to knit the Rmd due to rendering. Do not worry if yours look a bit bigger, it is more that you have them as **headers** is the key part. Your output should match the output of knitting [the .Rmd document found here](data/01-s01/inclass/ProducedPonzoTemplate.zip).
