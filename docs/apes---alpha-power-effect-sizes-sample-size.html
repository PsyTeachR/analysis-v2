<p>Up until now we have mainly spent time on data-wrangling, understanding probability, visualising our data, and more recently, running inferential tests, i.e. t-tests. In the lectures, however, you have also started to learn about additional aspects of inferential testing and trying to reduce certain types of error in your analyses. It is this balance of minimising error in our inferential statisitcs that we will focus on in this chapter.</p>
<p>First thing to remember is that there are two types of hypotheses in Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) and what you are trying to establish is the probability of the null hypothesis not being accepted. Those two hypotheses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>null hypothesis</strong> which states that the compared values <strong>are equivalent</strong> and, when referring to means, is written as: <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\)</span>
</li>
<li>And the <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> which states that the compared values <strong>are not equivalent</strong> and, when referring to means, is written as: <span class="math inline">\(H_1: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, each decision about a hypothesis is prone to some degree of error and, as you will learn, the two main types of error that we worry about in Psychology are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Type I error</strong> - or <strong>False Positives</strong>, is the error of rejecting the null hypothesis when it should not be rejected (otherwise called <strong>alpha</strong> or <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>). In other words, you conclude that there is a real "effect" when in fact there is no effect. The field standard rate of acceptable false positives is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .05\)</span> meaning that in theory 1 in 20 studies may be a false positive.</li>
<li>
<strong>Type II error</strong> - or <strong>False Negatives</strong>, is the error of retaining the null hypothesis when it is false (otherwise called <strong>beta</strong> or <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>). In other words, you conclude that there was no real "effect" when in fact there was one. The field standard rate of acceptable false negatives is <span class="math inline">\(\beta = .2\)</span> meaning that in theory 1 in 5 studies may be a false negative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding to the ideas of hypotheses and errors, we are going to look at the idea of <strong>power</strong> which you will learn is the long-run probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis for a fixed effect size and fixed sample size; i.e. correctly concluding there is an effect when there is a real effect to detect. Power is calculated as <span class="math inline">\(power = 1-\beta\)</span> and is directly related to the False Negative rate. If the field standard of False Negatives is <span class="math inline">\(\beta = .2\)</span> then the field standard of power should be <span class="math inline">\(power = 1 - .2 = .8\)</span>, for a given effect size and sample size (though some papers, including Registered Reports are often required to have a power of at least <span class="math inline">\(power &gt;= .9\)</span>). As such, <span class="math inline">\(power = .8\)</span> means that the majority of studies should find an effect if there is one to detect, assuming that your study maintains these rates of error and power.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, psychological research has been criticised for neglecting power and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> when planning studies resulting in what are called "underpowered" or "low powered" studies - meaning that your error rates are higher than you think they are, your power is lower than you think it is, and the study is unreliable. Note that as <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> increases (the false negative rate increases), power decreases; power and false positive rates are also related, though less directly. In fact, low powered studies, combined with undisclosed analytical flexibility and publication bias, is thought to be a key issue in the replication crisis within the field. As such there may be a large number of studies where the null hypothesis has been rejected when it should not have been, and unpublished studies that have not been written up because they did not find an effect when they should have. In turn, when that is the case, the field becomes noisy and you are unsure which studies will replicate. It is issues like this that led us to redevelop our courses and why we really want you to understand power as much as possible.</p>
<p>So this chapter is all about power, error rates, effect sizes, and sample sizes. We will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>the relationship between power, alpha, effect sizes and sample sizes</li>
<li>how to calculate certain effect sizes</li>
<li>how to determine appropriate sample sizes in given scenarios</li>
<li>and how to interpret power analyses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the following blog on Power: This blog is a fictional conversation between a professor and a student on the importance of power. Grab a coffee and have a read. Don't worry about reading all the additional papers unless you want to; just the blog is fine to get an understanding. What you are trying to understand from this blog is the relationship between sample size and effect sizes, and whether a result from a study is likely to replicate or not based on the power of the original study.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://pigee.wordpress.com/2016/09/13/the-power-dialogues/" target="_blank">The Power Dialogues</a> by PIGEE at the University of Illinois.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using power to design your study</strong></p>
<p>To reiterate, power is defined as the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis for a fixed effect size and fixed sample size. As such, power is a key decision when you design your study, under the premise that <strong>the higher the power of your planned study, the better</strong>.</p>
<p>Two relationships are important to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>for a given sample size and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the power of your study is higher if the effect you are looking for is assumed to be a large effect as opposed to a small effect; large effects are easier to detect.</li>
<li>and, for a given effect size and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the power of your study is higher when you increase your sample size.</li>
</ul>
<p>From these relationships we see that, because you have little control over the size of the effect you are trying to detect (it lives in the real world which you don't control), you can instead increase the power of your study by increasing the size of your sample (and also reducing sources of noise and measurement error in your study). As such, when planning a study, any good researcher will consider the following four key elements - the <strong>APES</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>alpha</strong> (the false positive rate - Type 1 error): most commonly thought of as the significance level; usually set at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .05\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>power</strong>: the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis for a given effect size and sample size, with <span class="math inline">\(power = .8\)</span> usually cited as the minimum power you should aim for based on the false negative rate being set at <span class="math inline">\(\beta = .2\)</span>;</li>
<li>
<strong>effect size</strong>: size of the association or difference you are trying to detect;</li>
<li>
<strong>sample size</strong>: the number of observations (usually, participants, but sometimes also stimuli) in your study.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> Because power depends on several variables, it is useful to think of power as a function with varying value rather than as a single fixed quantity.</p>
<p>Now the cool thing about the APES is that <strong>if you know any three of these elements, then you can calculate the fourth</strong>. In reality, the two most common approaches when designing a study would be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>to determine the appropriate sample size required to reject your null hypothesis, with high probability, for the effect size that you are interested in. That is, you decide your <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(power\)</span>, and effect size, and from that you calculate for the sample size required in your study. Generally, <strong>the smaller the assumed effect size, the more participants you will need</strong>, assuming power and alpha are held constant.</li>
<li>to determine the smallest effect size you can reliably detect given your sample size. That is, you know everything except the effect size. For example, say you are using an open dataset and you know they have run 100 participants, you can't add any more participants, and you want to know what is the minimum effect size you could detect from this dataset if you set <span class="math inline">\(power\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> at the field standards.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully that gives you an idea of how we use power to determine sample sizes for studies - and that the sample size should not just be pulled out of thin air. Both of these approaches described above are called <strong>a priori power analyses</strong> as you are stating the power level you want <strong>before</strong> (<em>a priori</em> means before) the study.</p>
<p>However, you may now be thinking, if everything is connected, then can we use the effect size from our study and the sample size to determine the power of the study after we have run it? No! Well, you can but it would be wrong to do so. This is actually called <strong>Observed</strong> or <strong>Post-Hoc</strong> power and most papers would discourage you from calculating it on the grounds that the effect size you are using is not the true effect size of the population you are interested in; it is just the effect size of your sample. As such any indication of power from this analysis is misleading. Avoid doing this. You can read more about why, here, in your own time if you like: <a href="http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2014/12/observed-power-and-what-to-do-if-your.html" target="_blank"> Lakens (2014) Observed Power, and what to do if your editor asks for post-hoc power analyses</a>. In short, stick to using only <strong>a priori power analyses</strong> approaches and use them to determine your required sample size or achievable reliable effect size.</p>

<p>Finally, there are a number of great webpages and blogs that will help you understand the concepts in this chapter. Here are some that we think might be good for you to look at. You don't have to look at all of these to understand this chapter, but do come back to them as they will really help you as you progress in becoming a responsible researcher. We are deliberately giving you a number of options here as for everyone there is that one analogy that will work best for you and that one paper that will make everything click into place. That example will be different from person to person so having a variety of explanations will help.</p>

<p>Hopefully this has given you a good basis to understanding power, sample sizes, alpha, and effect sizes. These are difficult concepts to grasp and it will take a lot of time thinking about them and interacting with them before they really start to sink in. Hopefully however, if nothing else, the least you come away with is the idea that the number of participants you should run in a study is not an arbitrary decision but is in fact a relationship between the effect size you want to test for and the level of error (Type I or Type II) you are willing to accept.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Practical APES Calculations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#practical-apes-calculations"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Hopefully you now have a decent understanding at least of the four APES that need to be considered when designing a study: <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(power\)</span>, effect size and sample size. We are going to look more at calculating and understanding these elements. You don't have to fully understand everything about power to complete this chapter - believe us when we say many seasoned researchers struggle with parts - you just need to get the general gist that there is always a level of acceptable error in hypothesis testing and we are trying to minimise that for a given effect size (i.e., the magnitude of the difference, relationship, association).</p>
<p>So let's jump into this a bit now and start running some analyses to help further our understanding of alpha, power, effect sizes and sample size! To help our understanding we will focus on t-tests for this chapter which you will know well from previous chapters.</p>
<p><strong>Effect Sizes - Cohen's <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span></strong></p>
<p>There are a number of different effect sizes that you can choose to calculate, but a common one for t-tests is <strong>Cohen's d</strong>: the standardised difference between two means (in units of SD) and is written as d = effect-size-value. The key point is that Cohen's d is a standardised difference, meaning that it can be used to compare against other studies regardless of how the measurement was made. Take for example height differences in men and women which is estimated at about 5 inches (12.7 cm). That in itself is an effect size, but it is an unstandardised effect size in that for every sample that you test, that difference is dependent on the measurement tools, the measurement scale, and the errors contained within them. As such using a standardised effect size allows you to make comparisons across studies regardless of measurement error. In standardised terms, the height difference above is considered a medium effect size (d = .5) which Cohen (1988, as cited by Schafer &amp; Schwarz (2019)) defined as representing "an effect likely to be visible to the naked eye of a careful observer". Cohen (1988) in fact stated three sizes of Cohen's d that people could use as a guide:</p>

<p>You may wish to read this paper later about different effect sizes in psychology - <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00813/full" target="_blank">Schafer and Schwarz (2019) The Meaningfulness of Effect Sizes in Psychological Research: Differences Between Sub-Disciplines and the Impact of Potential Biases</a>.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that the formula for Cohen's d is slightly different depending on the type of t-test used. And even within a type of t-test the formula can sometimes change depending on who you read. For this chapter, let's go with the following formulas:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-sample t-test &amp; within-subjects (paired-sample) t-test:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[d = \frac{t}{sqrt(N)}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Between-subjects (two-sample) t-test:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[d = \frac{2t}{sqrt(df)}\]</span></p>
<p>Let's now try using these formulas in order to calculate the effect sizes for given scenarios; we will work up to calculating power later in the chapter.</p>

</ul>
<div class="webex-solution">
<button>
Helpful Hint
</button>
<div class="info">
<ul>
<li>
Before you can calculate <code>d</code> (using the appropriate formula for a between-subjects experiment), you need to first calculate <code>t</code> using the formula:
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<code>t = (Mean1 - Mean2)/sqrt((var1/n1) + (var2/n2))</code>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>var</code> stands for variance in the above formula. Variance is not the same as the standard deviation, right? Variance is measured in squared units. So for this equation, if you require variance to calculate <code>t</code> and you have the standard deviation, then you need to remember that <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(var = SD^2\)</span></span> (otherwise written as <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(var = SD \times SD\)</span></span>.
</li>
<li>
Now you have your t-value, but for calculating <code>d</code> you also need degrees of freedom. Think about how you would calculate <code>df</code> for a between-subjects experiment, taking <code>n</code> for both Group 1 and Group 2 into account.
</li>
<li>
Remember that convention is that people report the <code>t</code> as a positive. As such, convention also dictates that <code>d</code> is reported as a positive value.

<p>Now that you are comfortable with calculating effect sizes, we will look at using them to establish the sample size for a required power. One thing you will realise as we progress is that the true effect size in a population is something we do not know, but we need to justify one for our design. A clever approach is laid out by Daniel Lakens in the blog from the previous section on the Smallest Effect Size of Interest (SESOI) - you set the smallest effect that you would be interested in! This can be determined through theoretical analysis, through previous studies, through pilot studies, or through rules of thumb like Cohen (1988). However, also keep in mind that the lower the effect size, the larger the sample size you will need. Everything is a trade-off!</p>
<p><strong>Power Calculations</strong></p>
<p>We are going to use the function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/pwr/man/pwr.t.test.html">pwr.t.test()</a></code> to run our calculations from the <strong><code>pwr</code></strong> library. This is a really useful library of functions for various tests, but we will just use it for t-tests right now.</p>
<p>Remember that for more information on the function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/pwr/man/pwr.t.test.html">pwr.t.test()</a></code>, simply do <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/pwr/man/pwr.t.test.html">?pwr.t.test</a></code> in the console. Or you can have a look at these webpages to get in idea (or bad ideas if you spot where they erroneously calculate post-hoc power!):</p>
<ul>
<li>A quick-R summary of the <strong><code>pwr</code></strong> package - <a href="https://www.statmethods.net/stats/power.html" target="_blank">https://www.statmethods.net/stats/power.html</a>
</li>
<li>the <strong><code>pwr</code></strong> package vignette - <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html" target="_blank"> https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From these you will see that <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/pwr/man/pwr.t.test.html">pwr.t.test()</a></code> takes a series of inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>n</strong>: observations/participants, <strong>per group</strong> for the independent samples version, or the <strong>number of subjects or matched pairs</strong> for the paired and one-sample designs.</li>
<li>
<strong>d</strong>: the effect size of interest</li>
<li>
<strong>sig.level</strong> or <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>power</strong> or <span class="math inline">\(1-\beta\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>type</strong>: the type of t-test; e.g. <code>"two.sample", "one.sample", "paired"</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>alternative</strong>: the type of hypothesis; <code>"two.sided", "one.sided"</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And it works on a leave one out principle. You give it all the info you have and it returns the element you are missing. So, for example, say you needed to know how many people per group you would need to detect an effect size as low as <code>d = .4</code> with <code>power = .8</code>, <code>alpha = .05</code> in a <code>two.sample (between-subjects) t-test</code> on a <code>two.sided</code> hypothesis test. You would do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb321"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">pwr.t.test</span><span class="op">(</span>d <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">.4</span>,
           power <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">.8</span>,
           sig.level <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">.05</span>,
           alternative <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"two.sided"</span>,
           type <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"two.sample"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which will show you the following output, which, if you look at it, tells you that you need 99.0803248 people per condition.</p>
<pre><code>## 
##      Two-sample t test power calculation 
## 
##               n = 99.08032
##               d = 0.4
##       sig.level = 0.05
##           power = 0.8
##     alternative = two.sided
## 
## NOTE: n is number in *each* group</code></pre>
<p>But you only get whole people and we like to be conservative on our estimates so we would actually run 100 <strong>per condition</strong>. That is a lot of people!!!</p>
<p>One problem though is that the output of the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/pwr/man/pwr.t.test.html">pwr.t.test()</a></code> is an object and not that easy to work with in terms of getting values out from it to be reproducible. However, the function <code>purr::pluck()</code> allows us to pluck values from objects. And the code would look like this</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb323"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">n_test</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">pwr.t.test</span><span class="op">(</span>d <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">.4</span>, 
                     power <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">.8</span>,
                     sig.level <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">.05</span>,
                     alternative <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"two.sided"</span>,
                     type <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"two.sample"</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
  <span class="fu">pluck</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"n"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So when we call <code>n_test</code> we get the same answer as above, but it is saved as a single value and easier to work with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb324"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">n_test</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 99.08032</code></pre>
<p>And we could use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">ceiling()</a></code> funtion to round up to whole people:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb326"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">n_test</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">ceiling</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 100</code></pre>
<p><em>Note:</em> <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">ceiling()</a></code> is better to use than <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">round()</a></code> when dealing with people as it always rounds up. For example, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">ceiling(1.1)</a></code> gives you 2. <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">round()</a></code> on the other hand is useful for rounding an effect size, for example, to two decimal places - e.g. d = <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">round(.4356, 2)</a></code> would give you d = 0.44</p>
<p>We will use this approach <code>pwr.t.test() %&gt;% pluck()</code> and <code>pwr.t.test() %&gt;% pluck() %&gt;% ceiling()</code> throughout the rest of this chapter to get used to it.
<strong>Before you start with this next task</strong>, you will need to make sure you have loaded in the <code>tidyverse</code>.</p>

<p><br><span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: var(--pink);">Thinking Cap Point</span></p>
<p>Based on what you have found out, think about the following questions and discuss them in your groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of the t-tests do you believe to be potentially underpowered?</li>
<li>Why do you think this may be?</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional information about this discussion can be found in the solutions at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p><em>One caveat to Tasks 6 and 7:</em> We have to keep in mind that here we are looking at single studies using one sample from a potentially huge number of samples within a population. As such there will be a degree of variance in the true effect size within the population regardless of the effect size of one given sample. What that means is we have to be a little bit cautious when making claims about a study. Ultimately the higher the power the better as you can detect smaller effect sizes!</p>
<p><strong>Concluding remarks</strong></p>
<p>So hopefully you are now starting to see the interaction between alpha, power, effect sizes, and sample size. We should always want high-powered studies and depending on the size of the effect we are interested in (small to large), and our <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> level, this will determine the number of observations we need to make sure our study is well powered. Points to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowering the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> level (e.g., .05 to .01) will reduce the power.</li>
<li>Lowering the effect size (e.g., .8 to .2) will reduce the power.</li>
<li>Increasing power (e.g., .8 to .9) will require more participants.</li>
<li>It is also possible to increase power for a fixed sample size by reducing sources of noise in the study.</li>
</ul>
<p>A high-powered study looking to detect a small effect size at a low alpha may require a large number of participants!</p>

<p><strong>Lab 8: APES Assignment</strong></p>
<p>In order to complete this assignment you first have to download the assignment .Rmd file which you need to edit for this assignment: titled <code>GUID_PracticeSkills_Ch8.Rmd</code>. This can be downloaded within a zip file from the below link. Once downloaded and unzipped you should create a new folder that you will use as your working directory; put the .Rmd file in that folder and set your working directory to that folder through the drop-down menus at the top <a href="data/08-s01/GUID_PracticeSkills_Ch8.zip">Download the assignment zip file from here</a>.</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: In nearly all of the problems below, you will need to replace <code>NULL</code> with a value or a pipeline of code that computes a value. Please pay special attention as to what the question is asking for as the output, e.g. <em>value</em> or a <em>tibble</em>; when asked for a <em>value</em> as an output, make sure it is a single value and not a value stored in a tibble. Finally, when altering code inside the code blocks, please <em>do not</em> re-order or rename the code blocks (T1, T2, ... etc.).</p>
<p>It's also recommended that you "knit" a report to be able to see what you've accomplished and spot potential errors. A great thing to do is close the whole programme, restart it, and then knit your code. This will test whether you have remembered to include essential elements, such as libraries, in your code.</p>
<p><strong>APES: Alpha, Power, Effect Size, and Sample Size</strong></p>
<p>In the chapter we have been looking at the interplay between the four components of Alpha, Power, Effect Size, and Sample Size. This is a very important part of experimental design to understand as it will help you understand which studies are worth paying attention to and it will help you design your own studies in the coming years so that you know just how many people to run and what to make of the effect that you find.</p>
<p><strong>Before starting let's check:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <code>.Rmd</code> file is saved in your working directory. For assessments we ask that you save it with the format <code>GUID_PracticeSkills_Ch8.Rmd</code> where <code>GUID</code> is replaced with your <code>GUID</code>. Though this is a formative assessment, it may be good practice to do the same here.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Study 2</strong></p>
<p>Below is a paragraph from the results of Experiment 4 from <em>Schroeder, J., &amp; Epley, N. (2015). The sound of intellect: Speech reveals a thoughtful mind, increasing a job candidate's appeal.</em> <em>Psychological Science</em>, <em>26</em>, <em>877-891</em>. We saw this paper previously but you can find out more details at &lt;a href="<a href="https://sites.trinity.edu/osl/data-sets-and-activities/t-test-activities" class="uri">https://sites.trinity.edu/osl/data-sets-and-activities/t-test-activities</a>", target = "_blank"&gt;Open Stats Lab.</p>
<p><em>Recruiters believed that the job candidates had greater intellect - were more competent, thoughtful, and intelligent - when they listened to pitches (M = 5.63, SD = 1.61, n = 21) than when they read pitches (M = 3.65, SD = 1.91, n = 18), t(37) = 3.53, p &lt; .01, 95% CI of the difference = [0.85, 3.13], <strong>d1 = 1.16</strong>. The recruiters also formed more positive impressions of the candidates - rated them as more likeable and had a more positive and less negative impression of them - when they listened to pitches (M = 5.97, SD = 1.92) than when they read pitches (M = 4.07, SD = 2.23), t(37) = 2.85, p &lt; .01, 95% CI of the difference = [0.55, 3.24], <strong>d2 = 0.94</strong>. Finally, they also reported being more likely to hire the candidates when they listened to pitches (M = 4.71, SD = 2.26) than when they read the same pitches (M = 2.89, SD = 2.06), t(37) = 2.62, p &lt; .01, 95% CI of the difference = [0.41, 3.24], <strong>d3 = 0.86</strong>.</em></p>

<li>Giving an achievable effect size of 0.51 and they found an effect size of 0.43.</li>
</ul>
<p>This effect might not be reliable given that the effect size found was much lower than the achievable effect size. The issue here is that the researchers established their sample size based on a previous effect size and not on the minimum effect size that they would find important. If an effect size as small as .4 was important then they should have powered all studies to that level and ran the appropriate n ~52 babies (see below). Flipside of course is that obtaining 52 babies isn't easy; hence why some people consider the Many Labs approach a good way ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ONE CAVEAT</strong> to the above is that before making the assumption that this study is therefore flawed, we have to keep in mind that this is one study using one sample from a potentially huge number of samples within a population. As such there will be a degree of variance in the true effect size within the population regardless of the effect size of one given sample. What that means is we have to be a little bit cautious when making claims about a study. Ultimately the higher the power the better.</p>
<p>Below you could calculate the actual sample size required to achieve a power of .8:</p>

<li>This study does not have enough power to detect effect sizes at d1 or lower and as such answer_t10 = 4</li>
<li>However, it is worth keeping in mind that we are only looking at one study here which drew one sample from a population of samples. This means that there is always uncertainty about the true effect size of a difference or association - taking a different sample may have given a different effect size. As such, the comparison we are making here is not entirely valid and we should see it more as a reminder that we should always think of power as more in the planning of studies rather than in the search for criticism.</li>
