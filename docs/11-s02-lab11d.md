## Test Yourself

This is a **formative** assignment meaning that it is purely for you to test your own knowledge, skill development, and learning, and does not count towards an overall grade. However, you are strongly encouraged to do the assignment as it will continue to boost your skills which you will need in future assignments. You will be instructed by the Course Lead on Moodle as to when you should attempt this assignment. Please check the information and schedule on the Level 2 Moodle page.

**Lab 11: Introduction to GLM: One-factor ANOVA**

In order to complete this assignment you first have to download the assignment .Rmd file which you need to edit for this assignment: titled `GUID_Level2_Semester2_Lab2.Rmd`. This can be downloaded within a zip file from the below link. Once downloaded and unzipped you should create a new folder that you will use as your working directory; put the .Rmd file in that folder and set your working directory to that folder through the drop-down menus at the top. [Download the Assignment .zip file from here](data/11-s02/homework/ch11-assign-file.zip) or on Moodle.

**Single Answer and Multiple Choice Questions**

For this assignment you will answer a series of short single and Mulitple Choice Questions, followed by a calculation of a decomposition matrix in the final task. In order to complete this formative assignment you will need to have completed the inclass activity and have read Miller and Haden Chapter 3.

**Before starting let's check:**

1. The `.Rmd` file is saved in a folder and that you have set your working directory to that folder. For assessments we ask that you save it with the format `GUID_Level2_Semester2_Lab2.Rmd` where `GUID` is replaced with your `GUID`. Though this is a formative assessment, it may be good practice to do the same here.

**Let's Begin!**

### Question 1 {#Ch11AssignQueT1}

Consider the following description of a study.

> You are investigating whether there is seasonal variation in students' bodyweight. In other words, is there any evidence that bodyweight differs across the four seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall - #AllYouGotToDoIsCall)?

Which of the models shown below would be the the general linear model corresponding to this study?

1. $Y_{ij} = \mu + A_{i} + S(A)_{ij}$
2. $Y_{ijkm} = \mu + A_{i} + B_{j} + C_{k} + D_{m} + S_{ijkm}$
3. $Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + e_{ij}$
4. $Y_{ijkm} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \beta_4 X_4 + e_{ijkm}$

Replace the NULL in the Q1 code chunk with the statement number that corresponds to the correct answer (e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 4).


```r
mcq1 <- NULL
```

----

For the next few questions consider the decomposition matrix for a one-factor design with three groups, shown below .

|$i$ | $j$ | $Y_{ij}$ | $\hat{\mu}$ | $\hat{A}_{i}$ | $\widehat{S(A)}_{ij}$
|---:|----:|---------:|------:|---------:|-----------:|
|1   |   1 | 4        | 6     |  -1      |  -1        |
|1   |   2 | 6        | 6     |  -1      |   1        |
|2   |   1 | 4        | 6     |   0      |  -2        |
|2   |   2 | 8        | 6     |   0      |   2        |
|3   |   1 | 2        | 6     |   1      |  -5        |
|3   |   2 | 12       | 6     |   1      |   5        |

### Question 2 {#Ch11AssignQueT2}

According to the above decomposition matrix, the population grand mean is estimated to be:

1. 0
2. 6
3. 36
4. can't answer; not observed

Replace the NULL in the Q2 code chunk with the statement number that corresponds to the correct answer (e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 4).


```r
mcq2 <- NULL 
```

### Question 3 {#Ch11AssignQueT3}

According to the above decomposition matrix, the value of $\hat{A}_3$ is:

1. 6
2. 0
3. 1
4. can't answer; not observed

Replace the NULL in the Q3 code chunk with the statement number that corresponds to the correct answer (e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 4).


```r
mcq3 <- NULL
```

### Question 4 {#Ch11AssignQueT4}

According to the above decomposition matrix, the predicted value for a participant in group 1 is what? 

**Hint**: this is the "fitted" or "typical" for that group ($\hat{Y}_{ij}$) as opposed to the actual value ($Y_{ij}$)

Replace the NULL in the Q4 code chunk with the actual value of the correct answer (e.g a number).


```r
Q4 <- NULL  # replace NULL with your answer (a number)
```

### Question 5 {#Ch11AssignQueT5}

Which observation or observations has/have the largest residual(s)?

1. $Y_{21}$
2. $Y_{21}$ and $Y_{22}$
3. $Y_{31}$
4. $Y_{31}$ and $Y_{32}$

Replace the NULL in the Q5 code chunk with the statement number that corresponds to the correct answer (e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 4).


```r
Q5 <- NULL
```

### Question 6 {#Ch11AssignQueT6}

From your reading of Miller and Haden Chapter 3, and from the inclass activity Section 5, based on the above decomposition matrix, what would $SS_{total}$ be for this model?

Replace the NULL in the Q6 code chunk with the actual value of the correct answer (e.g a number).


```r
Q6 <- NULL  # replace NULL with your answer (a number)
```

### Question 7 {#Ch11AssignQueT7}

From your reading of Miller and Haden Chapter 3, and from the inclass activity Section 5, based on the above decomposition matrix, what would $SS_{error}$ be for this model?

Replace the NULL in the Q7 code chunk with the actual value of the correct answer (e.g a number).


```r
Q7 <- NULL  # replace NULL with your answer (a number)
```

### Question 8 {#Ch11AssignQueT8}

From reading Miller and Haden Chapter 3, and from the inclass activity Section 5, a study with a one-factor design with GLM $Y_{ij} = \mu + A_{ij} + S(A)_{ij}$ is found to have the following SS:

* $SS_{total} = 280$, 
* $SS_{\mu} = 40$, 
* and $SS_{error} = 60$.  

Given those values, what is the value of $SS_{A}$?

**hint:** $SS_{total}$ = $SS_{\mu}$ + $SS_{A}$ + $SS_{error}$ 

Replace the NULL in the Q8 code chunk with the actual value of the correct answer (e.g a number).


```r
Q8 <- NULL # replace NULL with your answer (a number)
```


### Question 9: Create your own decomposition matrix {#Ch11AssignQueT9}

Finally, this last task tests your ability to set up a decomposition matrix as shown inclass. The code chunk below creates the basic table structure you will need to complete this task. Run the code and have a look at the table, but DO NOT CHANGE IT!


```r
## run this block, have a look at the structure of dsetup,
## but don't change anything

library("tidyverse")

dsetup <- tibble(i = rep(1:4, each = 3),
                 j = rep(1:3, times = 4),
                 Yij = NA,
                 mu = NA,
                 Ai = NA,
                 err = NA)
```

In the code chunk below, flesh out the values in `dsetup` to create a decomposition matrix for the data shown below (a one-factor design with four levels), but with the actual numeric values replacing the NA values.

- Group 1: 84, 86, 61
- Group 2: 83, 71, 95
- Group 3: 56, 95, 92
- Group 4: 68, 76, 93

**IMPORTANT!**

- Make sure the **final table with your result** has the name `dmx`.  Check spelling and capitalization.
- The values should be computed based on the `Yij` values such that if the `Yij` values were to change then your code would still produce the correct decomposition matrix.
- **DO NOT** change the column names, the column ordering, and make sure it has the right number of rows and columns. You should have 12 rows by 6 columns.
- Make sure your code runs without error in a fresh R session, and make sure no warnings are generated by the code chunk named `dmx_warning`, which validates your response.


```r
# TODO: DO STUFF WITH dsetup

# you can change or remove the line below,
# but make sure your final table is called dmx
dmx <- NULL 
```

Well done, you are finshed! Now you should go check your answers against the solutions which can be found at the end of this Chapter. You are looking to check that the resulting output from the answers that you have submitted are exactly the same as the output in the solution - for example, remember that a single value is not the same as a coded answer. Where there are alternative answers it means that you could have submitted any one of the options as they should all return the same answer. If you have any questions please post them on the available forums or speak to a member of the team.

On to the next chapter!
