## Solutions to Questions



Below you will find the solutions to the questions for the Activities for this chapter. Only look at them after giving the questions a good try and speaking to the tutor about any issues.

### InClass Activities

#### InClass Task 1 

**Question 1**

* $SS_{corrected\ total} = SS_{total} - SS_{\mu}$
* $SS_{total}$ = 91574
* $SS_{\mu}$ = 90000
* $SS_{corrected\ total}$ = 91574 - 90000 = 1574

**Question 2**

* $SS_{sound}$ = 504
* $SS_{corrected\ total}$ = 1574
* $SS_{sound} / SS_{corrected\ total}$ = 504 / 1574 = 0.32
    
**Question 3**

* $SS_{err}$ = 1070
* $SS_{corrected\ total}$ = 1574
* $SS_{err} / SS_{corrected\ total}$ = 1070 / 1574 = 0.68

#### InClass Task 2

**Question 1**

$\mu_{cafe} = \mu_{jazz} = \mu_{silence}$

**Question 2**

* k = number of conditions, so: 

df = k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2

**Question 3**

* N = 9, and $dfA_{i}$ = 2, so

df = 9 - 2 - 1 = 6
    
**Question 4**

* The factor df = 2


```r
ms_a <- dat_ss[["ss_sound"]] / 2L
```

* Giving $MS_{A}$ = 252

**Question 5**

* The residual df = 6


```r
ms_err <- dat_ss[["ss_err"]] / 6L
```

* Giving $MS_{S(A)}$ = 178.3333333

#### InClass Task 3

**Question 1**


```r
f_obs <- ms_a / ms_err
```

* Giving a F-value of F = 1.413 when rounded to three decimal places.

**Question 2**

The red line should be about F = 5.143, meaning that that is the minimum value of F, for those dfs, considered to be statistically significant at $\alpha = .05$

**Question 3**

Reading off the app, the approximate p-value for f_obs is p = .317.  

**Question 4**

As $p$ > $\alpha$ we would retain the null hypothesis that there is no significant effect of group in this study

**Question 5**

This could alternatively calculated using coding as such:


```r
pf(f_obs, 2, 6, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Which would give a p-value of p = 0.314 and again could be written up as F(2, 6) = 1.413, p = 0.314, suggesting no significant effect of ambiance or location on concentration as measured through the number of typos.

#### InClass Task 4


```r
dat <- select(dmx, sub_id, typos, sound)

results <- afex::aov_ez(data = dat,
                         dv = "typos",
                         id = "sub_id",
                         type = 3,
                         between = "sound")
```

```
## Converting to factor: sound
```

```
## Contrasts set to contr.sum for the following variables: sound
```

And when we look at the output table see:

<table>
<caption>(\#tab:afex-output2)ANOVA output</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;">   </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> Sum Sq </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> Df </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> F value </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> Pr(&gt;F) </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (Intercept) </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 90000 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 1 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 504.673 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.000 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> sound </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 504 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 1.413 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.314 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Residuals </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 1070 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 6 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;">  </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;">  </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>

From this we can see that the numbers we calculated match up exactly with the values that the function produced - F(2, 6) = 1.41, p = .31. You can also see that there is no significant effect and as such we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
