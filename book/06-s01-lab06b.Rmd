## Student's versus Welch's t-tests

The between-subjects t-test comes in two versions: one assuming equal variance in the two groups (Student's t-test) and another not making this assumption (Welch's t-test). while the Student's t-test is considered the more common and standard t-test in the field, it is advisable to use the Welch's t-test instead.

The blog post <a href = "https://daniellakens.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/always-use-welchs-t-test-instead-of.html" target = "_blank">"Always use Welch's t-test instead of Student's t-test"</a> by Daniel Lakens shows that if the groups have equal variance then both tests return the same finding. However, if the assumption of equal variance is violated, i.e. the groups have unequal variance, then Welch's test produces the more accurate finding, based on the data.

This is important as often the final decision on whether assumptions are "held" or "violated" is subjective; i.e. it is down to the researcher to fully decide. Nearly all data will show some level of unequal variance (with perfectly equal variance across multiple conditions actually once revealing fraudulent data). Researchers using the Student's t-test regularly have to make a judgement about whether the variance across the two groups is "equal enough". As such, this blog shows that it is always better to run a Welch's t-test to analyse a between-subjects design as a) Welch's t-test does not have the assumption of equal variance, b) Welch's t-test gives more accurate results when variance is not equal, and c) Welch's t-test performs exactly the same as the Student t-test when variance is equal across groups. 

In short, Welch's t-test takes a level of ambiguity (or what may be called a "researcher degree of freedom") out of the analysis and makes the analysis less open to bias or subjectivity. As such, from now on, unless stated otherwise, you should run a Welch's t-test. 

In practice it is very easy to run the Welch's t-test, and you can switch between the tests as shown: 
* to run a Student's t-test you set `var.equal = TRUE`
* to run a Welch's t-test you set `var.equal = FALSE`

This would run a Student's t-test:

```{r studentsexp, warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
t.test(my_dv ~ my_iv, data = my_data, var.equal = TRUE)
```

This would run the Welch's t-test:

```{r welchsexp, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
t.test(my_dv ~ my_iv, data = my_data, var.equal = FALSE)
```

And two ways to know that you have run the Welch's t-test are:

1. The output says you ran the **Welch Two Sample t-test**
2. The df is likely to have decimal places in the Welch's t-test whereas it will be a whole number in the Student's t-test.

Always run the Welch's t-test in a between-subjects design when using R!
